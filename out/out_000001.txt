Pages are put in this category by templates such as Disambiguationand {{Airport disambiguation}}.
That is, templates built with the dmboxmeta- template, which is doing the actual categorising.
Articles can be found using the search box on the top-right side of the screen.
Wikipedia is available in languages other than English.
Wikipedia has more than two hundred and eighty languages, including a Simple English version, and related projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, and scientific reference sources, and a news service .
All these are maintained, updated, and managed by separate communities, and often include information and articles that can be hard to find through other common sources.
Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced.
When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information.
Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead.
There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant external websites and pages, reference material, and organized categories of knowledge which can be searched and traversed in a loose hierarchy for more information.
Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other languages, and further information available on our sister projects.
Additional links can be easily made if a relevant link is missing—this is one simple way to contribute.
As wiki documents, articles are never considered complete and may be continually edited and improved.
Over time, this generally results in an upward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a neutral representation of information.
Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start: they may contain false or debatable information.
Indeed, many articles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint; and, after a long process of discussion, debate, and argumentation, they gradually take on a neutral point of view reached through consensus.
Others may, for a while, become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some time—months or years perhaps—to achieve a better balanced coverage of their subject.
In part, this is because editors often contribute content in which they have a particular interest and do not attempt to make each article they edit comprehensive.
However, eventually, additional editors expand and contribute to articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage.
In addition, Wikipedia operates a number of internal resolution processes that can assist when editors disagree on content and approach.
Usually, editors eventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article.
The ideal Wikipedia article is well written, balanced, neutral, and encyclopedic, containing comprehensive, notable, verifiable knowledge.
An increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already have.
Our best articles are called Featured Articles , and our second best tier of articles are designated Good Articles.
However, this is a process and can take months or years to be achieved through the concerted effort of editors.
Some articles contain statements which have not yet been fully cited.
Some information will be considered by later contributors to be insufficiently founded and, therefore, may be removed.
While the overall trend is toward improvement, it is important to use Wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source, since individual articles will, by their nature, vary in quality and maturity.
Guidelines and information pages are available to help users and researchers do this effectively, as is an article that summarizes third-party studies and assessments of the reliability of Wikipedia.
This category contains disambiguation pages : non- article pages containing links to other Wikipedia articles and disambiguation pages.
Disambiguation pages are added to Category:Disambiguation pages by placing the Disambiguationtemplate on the page itself.
Other templates are available that place articles in more specific disambiguation subcategories.
A page may also be assessed as "disambiguation-class" by various WikiProjects by including "|class=Disambig" in a WikiProject template on the talk page of the disambiguation page.
This places the talk page in a subcategory of Category:Disambig-Class articles.
Lists of disambiguation pages: Disambiguation pages can include links to Wiktionary, using wiktionary.
Categories are intended to group together pages on similar subjects.
Wikipedia is built around/with the principle that anyone can edit it, and it therefore aims to have as many of its pages as possible open for public editing so that anyone can add material and correct errors.
Disambiguation pages on Wikipedia are used as a process of resolving conflicts in article titles that occur when a single term can be associated with more than one topic, making that term likely to be the natural title for more than one article.
In other words, disambiguations are paths leading to different articles which could, in principle, have the same title.
For example, the word "Mercury" can refer to several different things, including an element, a planet, and a Roman god.
Since only one Wikipedia page can have the generic name "Mercury", unambiguous article titles are used for each of these topics: Mercury , Mercury , Mercury .
There must then be a way to direct the reader to the correct specific article when the ambiguous word "Mercury" is referenced by linking, browsing or searching; this is what is known as disambiguation.
In this case it is achieved using Mercury as the title of a disambiguation page.
Ospedaletto Lodigiano is a comune in the province of Lodi in the Italian region of Lombardy, located about 45 kilometres southeast of Milan and about 14 kilometres southeast of Lodi.
Ospedaletto Lodigiano borders the following municipalities: Brembio, Casalpusterlengo, Livraga, Somaglia, Orio Litta, Senna Lodigiana.
Wikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias.
First, it is not limited in space: it can keep growing as fast as people add to it.
Second, there are no qualifications required to be able to author its articles.
Therefore, it has a very large pool of contributors: the whole world.
This, and the first advantage mentioned above, have enabled Wikipedia to become the most comprehensive encyclopedia on Earth.
Third, a paper encyclopedia remains static and falls out of date until the next edition.
But Wikipedia is dynamic: you don't have to wait for the next edition to come out , as Wikipedia is published on-line as it is written on-line.
Articles are made available as is, regardless of what stage of development they are in.
You can update Wikipedia at any instant, and people do so continually around the clock, thereby helping each other to keep abreast of the most recent events everywhere and of the latest facts in every subject.
Fourth, Wikipedia has a very low "publishing" cost for adding or expanding entries, as it is on-line, with no need to buy paper or ink for distribution.
This has allowed it to be made available for free, making it more accessible to everyone.
This has enabled Wikipedia to be independently developed and published in many different languages at the same time, by people literate in each language.
Of the 290+ different language Wikipedias, 137 of them have 10,000 or more articles.
Fifth, Wikipedia has a low environmental impact in some respects, since it never needs to be printed, although computers have their own environmental cost.
Instead of in-line explanations, Wikipedia incorporates hypertext in the form of wikilinks.
Throughout its content is a robust network of links, providing another dimension of knowledge accessibility.
The encyclopedia also has correlates to tables of contents and indexes, with each entry in them hyperlinked to an article on the topic specified.
Seventh, each Wikipedia article provides an introduction summarizing the more extensive detail of its contents.
Eighth, being open to anyone to edit, articles on Wikipedia are subject to additions that might be erroneous or written poorly, which in turn are subject to being corrected or rewritten.
It is a community effort, with most people who are involved helping to improve the work, fixing problems they encounter along the way.
See more about Wikipedia's strengths and weaknesses, below ...
Wikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses, and differences all arise because it is open to anyone, it has a large contributor base, and its articles are written by consensus, according to editorial guidelines and policies.
The MediaWiki software that runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and changes, thus information added to Wikipedia never "vanishes" irreversibly.
Discussion pages are an important resource on contentious topics.
Therefore, serious researchers can often find a wide range of vigorously or thoughtfully advocated viewpoints not present in the consensus article.
A 2005 editorial by a BBC technology writer comments that these debates are probably symptomatic of cultural changes that are happening across all sources of information , and may lead to "a better sense of how to evaluate information sources".
Wikipedia disclaimers apply to all pages on Wikipedia.
However, the consensus in Wikipedia is to put all disclaimers only as links and at the end of each article.
Proposals to have a warning box at the beginning have been rejected.
Some do not like the way it looks or that it calls attention to possible errors in Wikipedia.
Wikipedia, in common with many websites, has a disclaimer that, at times, has led to commentators citing these in order to support a view that Wikipedia is unreliable.
A selection of similar disclaimers from places which are often regarded as reliable can be read and compared at Wikipedia:Non-Wikipedia disclaimers.
Anyone can contribute to Wikipedia by clicking on the Edit tab in an article.
Before beginning to contribute, however, read some handy helping tools such as the tutorial and the policies and guidelines, as well as our welcome page.
It is important to realize that in contributing to Wikipedia, users are expected to be civil and neutral, respecting all points of view, and add only verifiable and factual information rather than personal views and opinions.
"The five pillars of Wikipedia" cover this approach and are recommended reading before editing.
They are implemented by a MediaWiki feature that adds any page with a text like `[[Category: XYZ ]]` in its wikimarkup to the automated listing that is the category with name XYZ.
Categories help readers to find, and navigate around, a subject area, to see pages sorted by title, and to thus find article relationships.
Categories are normally found at the bottom of an article page.
Clicking a category name brings up a category page listing the articles that have been added to that particular category.
There may also be a section listing the subcategories of that category.
The subcategorization feature makes it possible to organize categories into tree-like structures to aid navigation.
The term category does refer to both the title of a category page—the category pagename —and the category itself.
Keeping this in mind while reading about categorization, plus learning a category page layout is a worthwhile investment in research techniques.
The layout of a category page is mostly text, but see about displaying category trees below.
The MediaWiki software maintains tables of categories , to which any editable page can be added.
To add a page to a category, include "`[[Category: Category name ]]`" or "`[[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]]`" in that page's wikimarkup.
The categories to which a page belongs appear in a box at the bottom of the page.
A category is usually associated with a category page in the "Category:" namespace.
A category page contains text that can be edited, like any other page, but when the page is displayed, the last part of what is displayed is an automatically generated list of all pages in that category, in the form of links.
Other category pages which appear in this list are treated separately, as subcategories.
A category page is any page in the Category namespace.
They each act as a category, and are termed a "category".
The category page has one section titled Subcategories listing other "categories", and one section titled Pages , listing pages as categorized .
New categories are created by creating a page in the Category namespace.
