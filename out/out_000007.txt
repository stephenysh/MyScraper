Under the protection policy, an alternative approach is available as administrators have the discretion to temporarily fully protect an article to end an ongoing edit war.
This approach may be better suited to multi-party disputes and contentious content as talk page consensus becomes a requirement for implementation of requested edits.
When protecting a page because of a content dispute, administrators have a duty to avoid protecting a version that contains policy-violating content, such as vandalism, copyright violations, defamation, or poor-quality coverage of living people.
Administrators remain uninvolved when exercising their discretion, subject to this proviso, to decide whether to apply protection to the most current version of an article, or to an older, stable, or pre-edit- war version.
Protected pages may not be edited except to make changes that are uncontroversial or for which there is clear consensus.
Editors convinced that the protected version of an article contains policy-violating content, or that protection has rewarded edit warring or disruption by establishing a contentious revision, may identify a stable version prior to the edit war and request reversion to that version.
Before making such a request, editors should consider how independent editors might view the suggestion and recognize that continuing an edit war is grounds for being blocked.
Administrators who have made substantive content changes to an article are considered involved and must not use their advanced permissions to further their own positions.
When involved in a dispute, it is almost always wisest to respect the editing policies that bind all editors and call for input from an uninvolved administrator, rather than to invite controversy by acting unilaterally.
Applying page protection as a preemptive measure is contrary to the open nature of Wikipedia and is generally not allowed if applied for these reasons.
However, brief periods of an appropriate and reasonable protection level are allowed in situations where blatant vandalism or disruption is occurring and at a level of frequency that requires its use in order to stop it.
The duration of the protection should be set as short as possible, and the protection level should be set to the lowest restriction needed in order to stop the disruption while still allowing productive editors to make changes.
If a deleted page is going through deletion review, only administrators are normally capable of viewing the former content of the page.
If they feel it would benefit the discussion to allow other users to view the page content, administrators may restore the page, blank it or replace the contents with TempUndelete or a similar notice, and fully protect the page to prevent further editing.
The previous contents of the page are then accessible to everyone via the page history.
Wikipedia also has portals, which organize content around topic areas.
Articles can be found using the search box on the top-right side of the screen.
Wikipedia is available in languages other than English.
Wikipedia has more than two hundred and eighty languages, including a Simple English version, and related projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, and scientific reference sources, and a news service .
All these are maintained, updated, and managed by separate communities, and often include information and articles that can be hard to find through other common sources.
Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced.
When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information.
Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead.
There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant external websites and pages, reference material, and organized categories of knowledge which can be searched and traversed in a loose hierarchy for more information.
Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other languages, and further information available on our sister projects.
Additional links can be easily made if a relevant link is missing—this is one simple way to contribute.
As wiki documents, articles are never considered complete and may be continually edited and improved.
Over time, this generally results in an upward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a neutral representation of information.
Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start: they may contain false or debatable information.
Indeed, many articles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint; and, after a long process of discussion, debate, and argumentation, they gradually take on a neutral point of view reached through consensus.
Others may, for a while, become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some time—months or years perhaps—to achieve a better balanced coverage of their subject.
In part, this is because editors often contribute content in which they have a particular interest and do not attempt to make each article they edit comprehensive.
However, eventually, additional editors expand and contribute to articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage.
In addition, Wikipedia operates a number of internal resolution processes that can assist when editors disagree on content and approach.
Usually, editors eventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article.
The ideal Wikipedia article is well written, balanced, neutral, and encyclopedic, containing comprehensive, notable, verifiable knowledge.
An increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already have.
Our best articles are called Featured Articles , and our second best tier of articles are designated Good Articles.
However, this is a process and can take months or years to be achieved through the concerted effort of editors.
I do some New Pages Patrol and occasionally come across someone who has copyrighted material he or she would like to donate to Wikipedia.
I'd like to direct such people to WP:Donating copyrighted materials, the intuitive shortcut to which is WP:DONATE, which redirects to the Donors subpage.
I'm not saying we should redirect the shortcut over there since the subpage does make more sense as a target, but I do think a hatnote to the effect of "'WP:DONATE' redirects here.
You may be looking for WP:Donating copyrighted materials." should be placed at the top of the Donors subpage.
I am aware of the actual shortcuts to Donating copyrighted materials and use them, but one can't generally guess them without looking at the page itself.

They are implemented by a MediaWiki feature that adds any page with a text like `[[Category: XYZ ]]` in its wikimarkup to the automated listing that is the category with name XYZ.
Categories help readers to find, and navigate around, a subject area, to see pages sorted by title, and to thus find article relationships.
Categories are normally found at the bottom of an article page.
Clicking a category name brings up a category page listing the articles that have been added to that particular category.
There may also be a section listing the subcategories of that category.
The subcategorization feature makes it possible to organize categories into tree-like structures to aid navigation.
The term category does refer to both the title of a category page—the category pagename —and the category itself.
Keeping this in mind while reading about categorization, plus learning a category page layout is a worthwhile investment in research techniques.
The layout of a category page is mostly text, but see about displaying category trees below.
The MediaWiki software maintains tables of categories , to which any editable page can be added.
To add a page to a category, include "`[[Category: Category name ]]`" or "`[[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]]`" in that page's wikimarkup.
The categories to which a page belongs appear in a box at the bottom of the page.
A category is usually associated with a category page in the "Category:" namespace.
A category page contains text that can be edited, like any other page, but when the page is displayed, the last part of what is displayed is an automatically generated list of all pages in that category, in the form of links.
Other category pages which appear in this list are treated separately, as subcategories.
A category page is any page in the Category namespace.
They each act as a category, and are termed a "category".
The category page has one section titled Subcategories listing other "categories", and one section titled Pages , listing pages as categorized .
New categories are created by creating a page in the Category namespace.
However, when it is displayed, the editable part of the page is followed by automatically generated lists of pages belonging to the category, as follows: The items in the lists all link to the pages concerned; in the case of the images this applies both to the image itself and to the text below it .
For the way in which the lists are ordered, see Sorting category pages below.
The first and second lists are divided into sections, according to the first character of the sort key.
