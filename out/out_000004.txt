Further sites were added in 1995, 2000, 2004, 2009, 2014, 2017, and 2018.
As of 2019, Denmark has ten sites inscribed on the list and a further four on the tentative list.
Three sites, Kujataa, Aasivissuit – Nipisat, and Ilulissat Icefjord, are located in Greenland, which is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.
Seven sites in Denmark are cultural and three are natural.
The natural site Wadden Sea is shared with Germany and the Netherlands.
In 2014, the Danish part of the site was added to the existing site in the other two countries, listed in 2009.
UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria.
Criteria i through vi are cultural, whereas vii through x are natural.
In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage list, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination.
Nominations for the World Heritage list are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list.
As of 2019[update], Denmark has recorded four sites on its tentative list.
, a 1997 educational film co-produced by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, before making appearances in minor television roles in the early 2000s.
Evans has described his filmography of the early to mid 2000s as being "really terrible." He appeared in the television comedy- drama Opposite Sex , comedies Not Another Teen Movie and The Perfect Score , and the action thriller Cellular .
In 2005, Evans had his breakthrough performance as Johnny Storm / Human Torch in the superhero film Fantastic Four , his highest-paid role at the time, and reprised the role for the film's 2007 sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.
Fantastic Four would be the first of many roles in films adapted from comic books and graphic novels for Evans, including Casey Jones in TMNT , Jake Jensen in The Losers , Lucas Lee in Scott Pilgrim vs.
His most prolific comic book movie role would be as Steve Rogers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe series of films, with credited appearances and cameos as the character in eleven films and one video game; notable appearances include the headlining films Captain America: The First Avenger , Captain America: The Winter Soldier , and Captain America: Civil War , and the ensemble films The Avengers , Avengers: Age of Ultron , Avengers: Infinity War , and Avengers: Endgame .
While comic book films formed the bulk of Evans' filmography from the late 2000s through the entirety of the 2010s, he concurrently acted in a range of non-comic book projects including Danny Boyle's psychological thriller Sunshine , the film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond , and Marc Webb's drama Gifted .
He also starred in several romantic comedy films, including The Nanny Diaries , What's Your Number?
, and Playing It Cool , the latter of which he also executive produced.
Evans made his directorial debut in 2014 with the romantic drama Before We Go , which he also produced and starred in.
His Broadway debut was in the 2018 revival of Kenneth Lonergan's play Lobby Hero , for which he was nominated for a Drama League Award.
He received critical acclaim for playing a rebellious scion in Rian Johnson's Knives Out .
English Wikipedia groups accented characters together with their unaccented version, so pages starting with À, Á, Ä, will be listed under heading A.
Sorting is case-insensitive, so "ABC" comes after "Abacus".
Unlike at Special:Allpages and Special:Prefixindex, a space is treated as a space , not as an underscore.
The English Wikipedia has numerical sorting in categories.
This means a page whose title begins with a number will be sorted according to the numeric value of the number .
Thus "9 dogs", "25 dogs", and "112 dogs" will all appear under the "0–9" heading in numeric order.
If the number includes a comma, space, or period, the sorting algorithm will only consider the part of the number before the separator.
Each of the three lists is arranged in the order explained above .
If an item ought to be positioned within a list on the basis of an alternative name for that item, then this can be specified in the category tag that places the item in the list: For example, to add an article called Albert Einstein to the category "People" and have the article sorted by "Einstein, Albert", you would type: Unlike a piped link , the sort key itself is not displayed to readers.
It affects only the order in which pages are listed on the category page.
It is useful to document the system being used for sort keys on the category page.
For guidelines about the use of sort keys on Wikipedia, see WP:SORTKEY.
It is possible to set a default sort key which is different from PAGENAME by using the magic word DEFAULTSORT: In the case of multiple default sort key tags, the last DEFAULTSORT on the final rendering of a page applies for all categories, regardless of the position of the category tags.
This also means that a DEFAULTSORT tag included from a template is not effective if another DEFAULTSORT tag occurs later on the page, even if the later DEFAULTSORT tag is also "hidden" .
In addition to browsing through hierarchies of categories, it is possible to use the search tool to find specific articles in specific categories.
To search for articles in a specific category, type incategory:" CategoryName " in the search box.
An "OR" can be added to join the contents of one category with the contents of another.
For example, enter to return all pages that belong to either of the categories, as here.
Note that using search to find categories will not find articles which have been categorized using templates.
This feature also doesn't return pages in subcategories.
Special:Categories provides an alphabetic list of all categories, with the number of members of each; this number does not include the content of the subcategories, but it includes the subcategories themselves, i.e., each counting as one.
The above list contains all categories that have members, regardless of whether they have corresponding category pages.
To list all existing category pages , use Special:AllPages/Category:.
As described at mw:Help:Magic words,  Example  or  Example  returns the number of pages in "Category:Example".
Each subcategory counts as one page; pages in subcategories are not counted.
The page Special:CategoryTree enables you to see the tree structure of a category .
The CategoryTree extension can be used to display such a tree on any page.
The basic syntax is to display just the subcategory tree, and to display member pages as well.
Dapete's category-visualizer vCat will render charts of the tree structure.
You may also use Template:Category tree or Template:Category tree all, instead.
Warning: Categories can be moved in the same way as an ordinary page; but a certain amount of cleanup may be necessary.
A redirect is left at the old category name, and this is not a normal `#REDIRECT [[...]]` but a category redirect.
Once all the pages have been moved out of the old category, it may be left as a category redirect or deleted.
Pre-emptive restrictions on new article titles are instituted through the title blacklist system, which allows for more flexible protection with support for substrings and regular expressions.
Pages that have been creation-protected are sometimes referred to as "salted".
Contributors wishing to re-create a salted title with appropriate content should either contact an administrator , file a request at Wikipedia:Requests for page protection, or use the deletion review process.
To make a convincing case for re-creation, it is helpful to show a draft version of the intended article when filing a request.
Administrators should choose the appropriate level of create protection—autoconfirmed, extended-confirmed, or full.
Due to the implementation of ACPERM, non-confirmed editors cannot create pages in mainspace; thus, semi-creation protection should be rare, used only for protection of pages outside of mainspace.
While creation-protection is usually permanent, temporary creation protection may be applied if a page is repeatedly recreated by a single user .
Move protected pages, or more technically, fully move-protected pages, cannot be moved to a new title except by an administrator.
Move protection is commonly applied to: Fully edit-protected pages are also implicitly move-protected.
As with full edit protection, protection because of edit warring should not be considered an endorsement of the current name.
When move protection is applied during a requested move discussion, the page should be protected at the location it was at when the move request was started.
All files are implicitly move-protected; only file movers and administrators can move files.
Upload protected files, or more technically, fully upload-protected files, cannot be replaced with new versions except by an administrator.
Upload protection does not protect file pages from editing.
Upload protection may be applied by an administrator to: As with full edit protection, administrators should avoid favoring one file version over another, and protection should not be considered an endorsement of the current file version.
An obvious exception to this rule is when files are protected due to upload vandalism.
Pending changes protection is a tool used to suppress vandalism and certain other persistent problems while allowing all users to continue to submit edits.
Pending changes protection can be used as an alternative to semi- protection to allow unregistered and new users to edit pages, while keeping the edits hidden from the view of most readers until those changes are accepted by a reviewer.
When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an unregistered editor or a new user, the edit is not directly visible to the majority of Wikipedia readers, until it is reviewed and accepted by an editor with the pending changes reviewer right.
When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an autoconfirmed user, the edit will be immediately visible to Wikipedia readers.
Pending changes are visible in the page history, where they are marked as pending review.
Readers not logged in are shown the latest accepted version of the page; logged-in users see the latest version of the page, with all changes applied.
When editors who are not reviewers make changes to an article with unreviewed pending changes, their edits are also marked as pending and are not visible to most readers.
A user who clicks "edit this page" is always, at that point, shown the latest version of the page for editing regardless of whether the user is logged in or not.
Reviewing of pending changes should be resolved within reasonable time limits.
Pending changes may be used to protect articles against: Pending changes protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against violations that have not yet occurred.
Like semi-protection, PC protection should never be used in genuine content disputes, where there is a risk of placing a particular group of editors at a disadvantage.
Pending changes protection should not be used on articles with a very high edit rate, even if they meet the aforementioned criteria.
In addition, administrators may apply temporary pending changes protection on pages that are subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption when blocking individual users is not a feasible option.
As with other forms of protection, the time frame of the protection should be proportional to the problem.
Indefinite PC protection should be used only in cases of severe long-term disruption.
Removal of pending changes protection can be requested of any administrator, or at requests for unprotection.
The reviewing process is described in detail at Wikipedia:Reviewing pending changes.
In the sport of cricket, a century is a score of one hundred or more runs by a batsman in a single innings.
Privacy law refers to the laws that deal with the regulation, storing, and using of personally identifiable information of individuals, which can be collected by governments, public or private organisations, or other individuals.
One of the first documented realizations Rustin had of his sexuality was when he mentioned to his grandmother that he preferred to spend time with males rather than females.
She responded, "I suppose that's what you need to do." In 1932, Rustin entered Wilberforce University, a historically black college in Ohio operated by the AME Church.
As a student at Wilberforce, Rustin was active in a number of campus organizations, including the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.
He was expelled from Wilberforce in 1936 after organizing a strike, and later attended Cheyney State Teachers College .
Cheyney honored Rustin with a posthumous "Doctor of Humane Letters" degree at its 2013 commencement.
After completing an activist training program conducted by the American Friends Service Committee , Rustin moved to Harlem in 1937 and began studying at City College of New York.
There he became involved in efforts to defend and free the Scottsboro Boys, nine young black men in Alabama who were accused of raping two white women.
He joined the Young Communist League for a small period of time in 1936, before becoming disillusioned with the party.
Soon after arriving in New York City, he became a member of Fifteenth Street Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends .
Rustin was an accomplished tenor vocalist, an asset which earned him admission to both Wilberforce University and Cheyney State Teachers College with music scholarships.
