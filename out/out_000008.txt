In cases where pages in other namespaces become transcluded to a very high degree, this protection level is also valid.
This is a protection level that replaces full protection on pages that are merely protected due to high transclusion rates, rather than content disputes.
It should be used on templates whose risk factor would have otherwise warranted full protection.
It should not be used on less risky templates on the grounds that the template editor user right exists—the existence of the right should not result in more templates becoming uneditable for the general editing community.
Editors may request edits to a template-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the `{{Edit template-protected}}` template if necessary to gain attention.
Semi-protection prevents edits from unregistered users , as well as edits from any account that is not autoconfirmed or confirmed.
This level of protection is useful when there is a significant amount of disruption or vandalism from new or unregistered users, or to prevent sockpuppets of blocked or banned users from editing, especially when it occurs on biographies of living persons who have had a recent high level of media interest.
An alternative to semi-protection is pending changes, which is sometimes favored when an article is being vandalized regularly, but otherwise receives a low amount of editing.
Such users can request edits to a semi-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the `{{Edit semi-protected}}` template if necessary to gain attention.
If the page in question and its talk page are both protected, please make your edit request at Wikipedia:Request for edit instead.
New users may also request the `confirmed` user right by visiting Requests for permissions.
Administrators may apply indefinite semi-protection to pages that are subject to heavy and persistent vandalism or violations of content policy .
Semi- protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against vandalism that has not yet occurred, nor should it be used to privilege registered users over unregistered users in content disputes.
In addition, administrators may apply temporary semi-protection on pages that are: Today's featured article may be semi-protected just like any other article.
But since that article is subject to sudden spurts of vandalism during certain times of day, administrators should semi-protect it for brief periods in most instances.
For the former guideline, see Wikipedia:Main Page featured article protection.
Administrators can prevent the creation of a page through the protection interface.
This is useful for bad articles that have been deleted but repeatedly recreated.
There are several levels of creation protection that can be applied to pages, identical to the levels for edit protection.
A list of protected titles may be found at Special:Protectedtitles .
Pre-emptive restrictions on new article titles are instituted through the title blacklist system, which allows for more flexible protection with support for substrings and regular expressions.
Pages that have been creation-protected are sometimes referred to as "salted".
Contributors wishing to re-create a salted title with appropriate content should either contact an administrator , file a request at Wikipedia:Requests for page protection, or use the deletion review process.
Some articles contain statements which have not yet been fully cited.
Some information will be considered by later contributors to be insufficiently founded and, therefore, may be removed.
While the overall trend is toward improvement, it is important to use Wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source, since individual articles will, by their nature, vary in quality and maturity.
Guidelines and information pages are available to help users and researchers do this effectively, as is an article that summarizes third-party studies and assessments of the reliability of Wikipedia.
Wikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias.
First, it is not limited in space: it can keep growing as fast as people add to it.
Second, there are no qualifications required to be able to author its articles.
Therefore, it has a very large pool of contributors: the whole world.
This, and the first advantage mentioned above, have enabled Wikipedia to become the most comprehensive encyclopedia on Earth.
Third, a paper encyclopedia remains static and falls out of date until the next edition.
But Wikipedia is dynamic: you don't have to wait for the next edition to come out , as Wikipedia is published on-line as it is written on-line.
Articles are made available as is, regardless of what stage of development they are in.
You can update Wikipedia at any instant, and people do so continually around the clock, thereby helping each other to keep abreast of the most recent events everywhere and of the latest facts in every subject.
Fourth, Wikipedia has a very low "publishing" cost for adding or expanding entries, as it is on-line, with no need to buy paper or ink for distribution.
This has allowed it to be made available for free, making it more accessible to everyone.
This has enabled Wikipedia to be independently developed and published in many different languages at the same time, by people literate in each language.
Of the 290+ different language Wikipedias, 137 of them have 10,000 or more articles.
Fifth, Wikipedia has a low environmental impact in some respects, since it never needs to be printed, although computers have their own environmental cost.
Instead of in-line explanations, Wikipedia incorporates hypertext in the form of wikilinks.
Throughout its content is a robust network of links, providing another dimension of knowledge accessibility.
The encyclopedia also has correlates to tables of contents and indexes, with each entry in them hyperlinked to an article on the topic specified.
Seventh, each Wikipedia article provides an introduction summarizing the more extensive detail of its contents.
Eighth, being open to anyone to edit, articles on Wikipedia are subject to additions that might be erroneous or written poorly, which in turn are subject to being corrected or rewritten.
It is a community effort, with most people who are involved helping to improve the work, fixing problems they encounter along the way.
See more about Wikipedia's strengths and weaknesses, below ...
Wikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses, and differences all arise because it is open to anyone, it has a large contributor base, and its articles are written by consensus, according to editorial guidelines and policies.
It is the dominant military service of the four uniformed services, controlling the most senior posts in the armed forces, and has the greatest manpower, approximately 80 percent of the combined services.
The Syrian Army originated in local military forces formed by the French after World War I, after France obtained a mandate over the region.
It officially came into being in 1945, before Syria obtained full independence the following year.
Since 1946, it has played a major role in Syria's governance, mounting six military coups: two in 1949, including the March 1949 Syrian coup d'état and the August 1949 coup by Colonel Sami al-Hinnawi, and one each in 1954, 1963, 1966, and 1970.
It has fought four wars with Israel and one with Jordan .
An armored division was also deployed to Saudi Arabia in 1990–91 during the Persian Gulf War, but saw little action.
From 1976 to 2005 it was the major pillar of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon.
Internally, it played a major part in suppressing the 1979–82 Islamist uprising in Syria, and since early 2011 has been heavily engaged in fighting the Syrian Civil War, the most violent and prolonged war the Syrian Army has taken part in since its establishment in the 1940s.
In 1919, the French formed the Troupes spéciales du Levant as part of the Army of the Levant in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon.
The former with 8,000 men later grew into both the Syrian and Lebanese armies.
This force was used primarily as auxiliaries in support of French troops, and senior officer posts were held by Frenchmen, although Syrians were allowed to hold commissions below the rank of major.
As Syria gained independence in 1946, its leaders envisioned a division-sized army.
On June 19, 1947, the Syrian Army took the survivors of Pan Am Flight 121 to the Presbyterian mission hospital at Deir ez-Zor.
The 1st Brigade was ready by the time of the Syrian war against Israel on May 15, 1948.
It consisted of two infantry battalions and one armored battalion.
The 2nd Brigade was organized during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and also included two infantry battalions and one armored battalion.
At the time of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the army was small, poorly armed, and poorly trained.
"Paris had relied primarily on French regulars to keep the peace in Syria and had neglected indigenous forces.
Consequently, training was lackadaisical, discipline lax, and staff work almost unheard of.
These troops were mostly grouped into three infantry brigades and an armored force of about battalion size" writes Pollack.
Between 1948 and 1967, a series of military coups destroyed the stability of the government and any remaining professionalism within the army.
In March 1949, the chief of staff, General Husni al-Za'im, installed himself as president.
Two more military dictators followed by December 1949.
General Adib Shishakli then held power until deposed in the 1954 Syrian coup d'etat.
Further coups followed, each attended by a purge of the officer corps to remove supporters of the losers from the force.
'Discipline in the army broke down across the board as units and their commanders pledged their allegiance to different groups and parties.
Indeed, by the late 1950s, the situation had become so bad that Syrian officers regularly disobeyed the orders of superiors who belonged to different ethnic or political groups' writes Pollack.
The 1963 Syrian coup d'état had as one of its key objectives the seizure of the Al-Kiswah military camp, home to the 70th Armored Brigade.
However, in 1967 the army did appear to have some strength.
It had around 70,000 personnel, roughly 550 tanks and assault guns, 500 APCs, and nearly 300 artillery pieces.
The army had sixteen brigades: twelve infantry, two armored , and two mechanized.
The Syrian government deployed twelve of the sixteen brigades to the Golan, including both armored brigades and one mechanized brigade.
, a 1997 educational film co-produced by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, before making appearances in minor television roles in the early 2000s.
Evans has described his filmography of the early to mid 2000s as being "really terrible." He appeared in the television comedy- drama Opposite Sex , comedies Not Another Teen Movie and The Perfect Score , and the action thriller Cellular .
In 2005, Evans had his breakthrough performance as Johnny Storm / Human Torch in the superhero film Fantastic Four , his highest-paid role at the time, and reprised the role for the film's 2007 sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.

While comic book films formed the bulk of Evans' filmography from the late 2000s through the entirety of the 2010s, he concurrently acted in a range of non-comic book projects including Danny Boyle's psychological thriller Sunshine , the film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond , and Marc Webb's drama Gifted .
He also starred in several romantic comedy films, including The Nanny Diaries , What's Your Number?
, and Playing It Cool , the latter of which he also executive produced.
Evans made his directorial debut in 2014 with the romantic drama Before We Go , which he also produced and starred in.
His Broadway debut was in the 2018 revival of Kenneth Lonergan's play Lobby Hero , for which he was nominated for a Drama League Award.
He received critical acclaim for playing a rebellious scion in Rian Johnson's Knives Out .
The Prime Minister directs both the executive and the legislature, and together with their Cabinet is accountable to the Monarch, to Parliament, to their party, and ultimately to the electorate, for the government's policies and actions.
The Office of the Prime Minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the reigning Monarch appoints as Prime Minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber.
The position of Prime Minister was not created; it evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history.
The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective.
The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament.
Although the sovereign was not stripped of the ancient prerogative powers and legally remained the head of government, politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a Prime Minister who could command a majority in Parliament.
By the 1830s, the Westminster system of government had emerged; the Prime Minister had become primus inter pares or the first among equals in the Cabinet and the head of government in the United Kingdom.
The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties, the introduction of mass communication and photography.
