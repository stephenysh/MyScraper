Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (![About this sound], /ˌwɪkiˈpiːdiə/ (![About this sound] is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and based on a model of openly editable content.
The name "Wikipedia" is a portmanteau of the words wiki and encyclopedia.
Wikipedia's articles provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with additional information.
Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay.
Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism.
Users can contribute anonymously, under a pseudonym, or, if they choose to, with their real identity.
The fundamental principles by which Wikipedia operates are the five pillars.
The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines to improve the encyclopedia; however, it is not a formal requirement to be familiar with them before contributing.
Since its creation on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has grown rapidly into one of the largest reference websites, attracting 374 million unique visitors monthly as of September 2015[update].
There are about 68,000 active contributors working on more than 48,000,000 articles in 302 languages.
As of today, there are 6,009,373 articles in English.
Every day, hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world collectively make tens of thousands of edits and create thousands of new articles to augment the knowledge held by the Wikipedia encyclopedia.
People of all ages, cultures and backgrounds can add or edit article prose, references, images and other media here.
What is contributed is more important than the expertise or qualifications of the contributor.
What will remain depends upon whether the content is free of copyright restrictions and contentious material about living people, and whether it fits within Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable against a published reliable source, thereby excluding editors' opinions and beliefs and unreviewed research.
Contributions cannot damage Wikipedia because the software allows easy reversal of mistakes and many experienced editors are watching to help ensure that edits are cumulative improvements.
Begin by simply clicking the Edit link at the top of any editable page!
Wikipedia is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways.
Unlike printed encyclopedias, Wikipedia is continually created and updated, with articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years.
Because everybody can help improve it, Wikipedia has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia.
In addition to quantity, its contributors work on improving quality as well.
Wikipedia is a work-in-progress, with articles in various stages of completion.
As articles develop, they tend to become more comprehensive and balanced.
Quality also improves over time as misinformation and other errors are removed or repaired.
However, because anyone can click "edit" at any time and add content, any article may contain undetected misinformation, errors, or vandalism.
Awareness of this helps the reader to obtain valid information, avoid recently added misinformation , and fix the article.
See also: Wikipedia:FAQ and Wikipedia:Citing Wikipedia Wikipedia was founded as an offshoot of Nupedia, a now-abandoned project to produce a free encyclopedia, begun by the online media company Bomis.
Nupedia had an elaborate system of peer review and required highly qualified contributors, but the writing of articles was slow.
During 2000, Jimmy Wales , and Larry Sanger, whom Wales had employed to work on the encyclopedia project, discussed ways of supplementing Nupedia with a more open, complementary project.
Multiple sources suggested that a wiki might allow members of the public to contribute material, and Nupedia's first wiki went online on January 10, 2001.
There was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors and reviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a website in the wiki format, so the new project was given the name "Wikipedia" and launched on its own domain, wikipedia.com, on January 15 .
Other current and past Bomis employees who have worked on the project include Tim Shell, one of the cofounders of Bomis and its current CEO, and programmer Jason Richey.
In May 2001, a large number of non-English Wikipedias were launched—in Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, Esperanto, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.
In September, Polish was added, and further commitment to the multilingual provision of Wikipedia was made.
At the end of the year, Afrikaans, Norwegian, and Serbo-Croatian versions were announced.
This is a tracking category for disambiguation pages.
Contains pages with short descriptions defined on Wikipedia by short description.
The domain was eventually changed to the present wikipedia.org when the not- for-profit Wikimedia Foundation was launched, in 2003, as its new parent organization, with the ".org" top-level domain denoting its non-commercial nature.
Anyone with Web access can edit Wikipedia, and this openness encourages inclusion of a tremendous amount of content.
About 70,000 editors—from expert scholars to casual readers—regularly edit Wikipedia, and these experienced editors often help to create a consistent style throughout the encyclopedia, following our Manual of Style.
Several mechanisms are in place to help Wikipedia members carry out the important work of crafting a high-quality resource while maintaining civility.
Editors are able to watch pages and technically skilled persons can write editing programs to keep track of or rectify bad edits.
Where there are disagreements on how to display facts, editors often work together to compile an article that fairly represents current expert opinion on the subject.
Aspiring authors may wish to read the information on Contributing to Wikipedia before contributing to the project.
Although the Wikimedia Foundation owns the site, it is largely uninvolved in writing and daily operations.
"Wikipedia" is a registered trademark of the not-for-profit Wikimedia Foundation, which has created a family of free-content projects that are built by user contributions.
Most of Wikipedia's text and many of its images are dual-licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License and the GNU Free Documentation License .
Some text has been imported only under CC-BY-SA and CC-BY-SA-compatible license and cannot be reused under GFDL; such text is identified either on the page footer, in the page history or on the discussion page of the article that utilizes the text.
Every image has a description page that indicates the license under which it is released or, if it is non-free, the rationale under which it is used.
Contributions remain the property of their creators, while the CC-BY-SA and GFDL licenses ensure the content is freely distributable and reproducible.
Text on Wikipedia is a collaborative work, and the efforts of individual contributors to a page are recorded in that page's history, which is publicly viewable.
Information on the authorship of images and other media, such as sound files, can be found by clicking on the image itself or the nearby information icon to display the file page, which includes the author and source, where appropriate, along with other information.
Many visitors come to Wikipedia to acquire knowledge, while others come to share knowledge.
At this very instant, dozens of articles are being improved, and new articles are also being created.
Changes can be viewed at the Recent changes page and a random page at random articles.
Over 5,600 articles have been designated by the Wikipedia community as featured articles, exemplifying the best articles in the encyclopedia.
Another 30,000 articles are designated as good articles.
Some information on Wikipedia is organized into lists; the best of these are designated as featured lists.
Wikipedia also has portals, which organize content around topic areas.
Disambiguation in Wikipedia is the process of resolving the conflicts that occur when articles about two or more different topics could have the same "natural" page title.
It enables us to use All article disambiguation pages to get the exact number of disambiguation pages in the main namespace.
Pages are put in this category by templates such as Disambiguationand {{Airport disambiguation}}.
That is, templates built with the dmboxmeta- template, which is doing the actual categorising.
Articles can be found using the search box on the top-right side of the screen.
Wikipedia is available in languages other than English.
Wikipedia has more than two hundred and eighty languages, including a Simple English version, and related projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, and scientific reference sources, and a news service .
All these are maintained, updated, and managed by separate communities, and often include information and articles that can be hard to find through other common sources.
Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced.
When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information.
Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead.
There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant external websites and pages, reference material, and organized categories of knowledge which can be searched and traversed in a loose hierarchy for more information.
Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other languages, and further information available on our sister projects.
Additional links can be easily made if a relevant link is missing—this is one simple way to contribute.
As wiki documents, articles are never considered complete and may be continually edited and improved.
Over time, this generally results in an upward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a neutral representation of information.
Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start: they may contain false or debatable information.
Indeed, many articles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint; and, after a long process of discussion, debate, and argumentation, they gradually take on a neutral point of view reached through consensus.
Others may, for a while, become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some time—months or years perhaps—to achieve a better balanced coverage of their subject.
In part, this is because editors often contribute content in which they have a particular interest and do not attempt to make each article they edit comprehensive.
However, eventually, additional editors expand and contribute to articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage.
In addition, Wikipedia operates a number of internal resolution processes that can assist when editors disagree on content and approach.
Usually, editors eventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article.
The ideal Wikipedia article is well written, balanced, neutral, and encyclopedic, containing comprehensive, notable, verifiable knowledge.
An increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already have.
Our best articles are called Featured Articles , and our second best tier of articles are designated Good Articles.
However, this is a process and can take months or years to be achieved through the concerted effort of editors.
Some articles contain statements which have not yet been fully cited.
Some information will be considered by later contributors to be insufficiently founded and, therefore, may be removed.
While the overall trend is toward improvement, it is important to use Wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source, since individual articles will, by their nature, vary in quality and maturity.
Guidelines and information pages are available to help users and researchers do this effectively, as is an article that summarizes third-party studies and assessments of the reliability of Wikipedia.
This category contains disambiguation pages : non- article pages containing links to other Wikipedia articles and disambiguation pages.
Disambiguation pages are added to Category:Disambiguation pages by placing the Disambiguationtemplate on the page itself.
Other templates are available that place articles in more specific disambiguation subcategories.
A page may also be assessed as "disambiguation-class" by various WikiProjects by including "|class=Disambig" in a WikiProject template on the talk page of the disambiguation page.
This places the talk page in a subcategory of Category:Disambig-Class articles.
Lists of disambiguation pages: Disambiguation pages can include links to Wiktionary, using wiktionary.
Categories are intended to group together pages on similar subjects.
Wikipedia is built around/with the principle that anyone can edit it, and it therefore aims to have as many of its pages as possible open for public editing so that anyone can add material and correct errors.
Disambiguation pages on Wikipedia are used as a process of resolving conflicts in article titles that occur when a single term can be associated with more than one topic, making that term likely to be the natural title for more than one article.
In other words, disambiguations are paths leading to different articles which could, in principle, have the same title.
For example, the word "Mercury" can refer to several different things, including an element, a planet, and a Roman god.
Since only one Wikipedia page can have the generic name "Mercury", unambiguous article titles are used for each of these topics: Mercury , Mercury , Mercury .
There must then be a way to direct the reader to the correct specific article when the ambiguous word "Mercury" is referenced by linking, browsing or searching; this is what is known as disambiguation.
In this case it is achieved using Mercury as the title of a disambiguation page.
Ospedaletto Lodigiano is a comune in the province of Lodi in the Italian region of Lombardy, located about 45 kilometres southeast of Milan and about 14 kilometres southeast of Lodi.
Ospedaletto Lodigiano borders the following municipalities: Brembio, Casalpusterlengo, Livraga, Somaglia, Orio Litta, Senna Lodigiana.
Wikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias.
First, it is not limited in space: it can keep growing as fast as people add to it.
Second, there are no qualifications required to be able to author its articles.
Therefore, it has a very large pool of contributors: the whole world.
This, and the first advantage mentioned above, have enabled Wikipedia to become the most comprehensive encyclopedia on Earth.
Third, a paper encyclopedia remains static and falls out of date until the next edition.
But Wikipedia is dynamic: you don't have to wait for the next edition to come out , as Wikipedia is published on-line as it is written on-line.
Articles are made available as is, regardless of what stage of development they are in.
You can update Wikipedia at any instant, and people do so continually around the clock, thereby helping each other to keep abreast of the most recent events everywhere and of the latest facts in every subject.
Fourth, Wikipedia has a very low "publishing" cost for adding or expanding entries, as it is on-line, with no need to buy paper or ink for distribution.
This has allowed it to be made available for free, making it more accessible to everyone.
This has enabled Wikipedia to be independently developed and published in many different languages at the same time, by people literate in each language.
Of the 290+ different language Wikipedias, 137 of them have 10,000 or more articles.
Fifth, Wikipedia has a low environmental impact in some respects, since it never needs to be printed, although computers have their own environmental cost.
Instead of in-line explanations, Wikipedia incorporates hypertext in the form of wikilinks.
Throughout its content is a robust network of links, providing another dimension of knowledge accessibility.
The encyclopedia also has correlates to tables of contents and indexes, with each entry in them hyperlinked to an article on the topic specified.
Seventh, each Wikipedia article provides an introduction summarizing the more extensive detail of its contents.
Eighth, being open to anyone to edit, articles on Wikipedia are subject to additions that might be erroneous or written poorly, which in turn are subject to being corrected or rewritten.
It is a community effort, with most people who are involved helping to improve the work, fixing problems they encounter along the way.
See more about Wikipedia's strengths and weaknesses, below ...
Wikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses, and differences all arise because it is open to anyone, it has a large contributor base, and its articles are written by consensus, according to editorial guidelines and policies.
The MediaWiki software that runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and changes, thus information added to Wikipedia never "vanishes" irreversibly.
Discussion pages are an important resource on contentious topics.
Therefore, serious researchers can often find a wide range of vigorously or thoughtfully advocated viewpoints not present in the consensus article.
A 2005 editorial by a BBC technology writer comments that these debates are probably symptomatic of cultural changes that are happening across all sources of information , and may lead to "a better sense of how to evaluate information sources".
Wikipedia disclaimers apply to all pages on Wikipedia.
However, the consensus in Wikipedia is to put all disclaimers only as links and at the end of each article.
Proposals to have a warning box at the beginning have been rejected.
Some do not like the way it looks or that it calls attention to possible errors in Wikipedia.
Wikipedia, in common with many websites, has a disclaimer that, at times, has led to commentators citing these in order to support a view that Wikipedia is unreliable.
A selection of similar disclaimers from places which are often regarded as reliable can be read and compared at Wikipedia:Non-Wikipedia disclaimers.
Anyone can contribute to Wikipedia by clicking on the Edit tab in an article.
Before beginning to contribute, however, read some handy helping tools such as the tutorial and the policies and guidelines, as well as our welcome page.
It is important to realize that in contributing to Wikipedia, users are expected to be civil and neutral, respecting all points of view, and add only verifiable and factual information rather than personal views and opinions.
"The five pillars of Wikipedia" cover this approach and are recommended reading before editing.
They are implemented by a MediaWiki feature that adds any page with a text like `[[Category: XYZ ]]` in its wikimarkup to the automated listing that is the category with name XYZ.
Categories help readers to find, and navigate around, a subject area, to see pages sorted by title, and to thus find article relationships.
Categories are normally found at the bottom of an article page.
Clicking a category name brings up a category page listing the articles that have been added to that particular category.
There may also be a section listing the subcategories of that category.
The subcategorization feature makes it possible to organize categories into tree-like structures to aid navigation.
The term category does refer to both the title of a category page—the category pagename —and the category itself.
Keeping this in mind while reading about categorization, plus learning a category page layout is a worthwhile investment in research techniques.
The layout of a category page is mostly text, but see about displaying category trees below.
The MediaWiki software maintains tables of categories , to which any editable page can be added.
To add a page to a category, include "`[[Category: Category name ]]`" or "`[[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]]`" in that page's wikimarkup.
The categories to which a page belongs appear in a box at the bottom of the page.
A category is usually associated with a category page in the "Category:" namespace.
A category page contains text that can be edited, like any other page, but when the page is displayed, the last part of what is displayed is an automatically generated list of all pages in that category, in the form of links.
Other category pages which appear in this list are treated separately, as subcategories.
A category page is any page in the Category namespace.
They each act as a category, and are termed a "category".
The category page has one section titled Subcategories listing other "categories", and one section titled Pages , listing pages as categorized .
New categories are created by creating a page in the Category namespace.
However, when it is displayed, the editable part of the page is followed by automatically generated lists of pages belonging to the category, as follows: The items in the lists all link to the pages concerned; in the case of the images this applies both to the image itself and to the text below it .
For the way in which the lists are ordered, see Sorting category pages below.
The first and second lists are divided into sections, according to the first character of the sort key.
These initial characters are displayed above the sections.
To suppress these, make all sort keys start with a space.
A category page can only display a limited number of items .
However, in some particular circumstances, because of a specifically identified likelihood of damage resulting if editing is left open, some individual pages may need to be subject to technical restrictions on who is permitted to modify them.
The placing of such restrictions on pages is called protection.
Protection can be applied to or removed from pages only by Wikipedia's administrators, although any user may request protection.
Protection can be indefinite or expire after a specified time period.
The most commonly used types of protection are full protection , which means that a page can be modified only by administrators; and semi- protection , which means that a page can be modified only by users who are logged in and whose accounts have been confirmed .
Protected pages are marked with a small padlock icon in the top right corner of the article page; different color padlocks represent different protection types, as shown in the images at the right.
The template `{{pp-protected}}` is usually placed on protected pages to display the padlock.
Even when protected, the source code of the page can still be viewed and copied by any user.
Placing the mouse pointer over a padlock icon produces an informational tooltip saying "This article is protected." If the padlock template's 'reason' parameter is specified, the tooltip also says why the page is protected.
If the 'expiry' parameter is specified, the tooltip says for what duration the page is protected.
This policy explains in detail the protection types and procedures for page protection and unprotection and the reasons for which protection should and should not be applied.
The following technical options are available to administrators for protecting different actions to pages: The following technical options are available to administrators for adding protection levels to the different actions to pages: Any type of protection may be requested at Wikipedia:Requests for page protection.
Changes to a fully protected page should be proposed on the corresponding talk page, and carried out by an administrator if they are uncontroversial or if there is consensus for them.
Except in the case of office actions , Arbitration Committee remedies, or pages in the MediaWiki namespace , administrators may unprotect a page if the reason for its protection no longer applies, a reasonable period has elapsed, and there is no consensus that continued protection is necessary.
Editors desiring the unprotection of a page should, in the first instance, ask the administrator who applied the protection unless the administrator is inactive or no longer an administrator; thereafter, requests may be made at Requests for unprotection.
Note that such requests will normally be declined if the protecting administrator is active and was not consulted first.
A log of protections and unprotections is available at Special:Log/protect.
A fully protected page can be edited or moved only by administrators.
The protection may be for a specified time or may be indefinite.
Modifications to a fully protected page can be proposed on its talk page for discussion.
Administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting consensus.
Placing the Edit fully protected template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.
Content disputes and edit warring may be addressed with blocks issued by uninvolved administrators while allowing normal page editing by other editors.
Under the protection policy, an alternative approach is available as administrators have the discretion to temporarily fully protect an article to end an ongoing edit war.
This approach may be better suited to multi-party disputes and contentious content as talk page consensus becomes a requirement for implementation of requested edits.
When protecting a page because of a content dispute, administrators have a duty to avoid protecting a version that contains policy-violating content, such as vandalism, copyright violations, defamation, or poor-quality coverage of living people.
Administrators remain uninvolved when exercising their discretion, subject to this proviso, to decide whether to apply protection to the most current version of an article, or to an older, stable, or pre-edit- war version.
Protected pages may not be edited except to make changes that are uncontroversial or for which there is clear consensus.
Editors convinced that the protected version of an article contains policy-violating content, or that protection has rewarded edit warring or disruption by establishing a contentious revision, may identify a stable version prior to the edit war and request reversion to that version.
Before making such a request, editors should consider how independent editors might view the suggestion and recognize that continuing an edit war is grounds for being blocked.
Administrators who have made substantive content changes to an article are considered involved and must not use their advanced permissions to further their own positions.
When involved in a dispute, it is almost always wisest to respect the editing policies that bind all editors and call for input from an uninvolved administrator, rather than to invite controversy by acting unilaterally.
Applying page protection as a preemptive measure is contrary to the open nature of Wikipedia and is generally not allowed if applied for these reasons.
There are three principal disambiguation scenarios, of which the following are examples: Occasionally a reader may follow a link that ends up at a disambiguation page rather than at one of the links shown on that page.
The original page can be edited to link directly to its intended destination.
Feel free to make such edits; everyone is welcome to improve Wikipedia, including you.
It could be you who makes the overall experience of Wikipedia that much better.
Bayard Rustin was an American leader in social movements for civil rights, socialism, nonviolence, and gay rights.
I do some New Pages Patrol and occasionally come across someone who has copyrighted material he or she would like to donate to Wikipedia.
I'd like to direct such people to WP:Donating copyrighted materials, the intuitive shortcut to which is WP:DONATE, which redirects to the Donors subpage.
I'm not saying we should redirect the shortcut over there since the subpage does make more sense as a target, but I do think a hatnote to the effect of "'WP:DONATE' redirects here.
You may be looking for WP:Donating copyrighted materials." should be placed at the top of the Donors subpage.
I am aware of the actual shortcuts to Donating copyrighted materials and use them, but one can't generally guess them without looking at the page itself.

Most articles start as stubs, but after many contributions, they can become featured articles.
Once the contributor has decided a topic of interest, they may want to request that the article be written .
Wikipedia has on-going projects, focused on specific topic areas or tasks, which help coordinate editing.
The ease of editing Wikipedia results in many people editing.
That makes the updating of the encyclopedia very quick, almost as fast as news websites.
Wikipedia uses a simple yet powerful page layout to allow editors to concentrate on adding material rather than page design.
Page aspects facilitated include: Normally editing is chosen by clicking the `Edit` tab at the top of a Wikipedia page .
This will take you to a new page with a text box containing the editable text of the page you were viewing.
In this box, you can type in the text that you want to add, using wiki markup to format the text and add other elements like images and tables.
You should then press the `Show preview` button to review your contributions for any errors.
When you have finished editing, you should write a short edit summary in the small field below the edit-box describing your changes before you press the `Publish changes` button.
This will help others to understand the intention of your edit.
To avoid accidentally leaving edit summaries blank, you can select "Prompt me when entering a blank edit summary" on the `Edit` tab of your personal preferences.
Page editing is accessed through tabs that are found along the top edge of the page.
These are: Wikipedia has robust version and reversion controls.
This means that poor- quality edits or vandalism can quickly and easily be reversed or brought up to an appropriate standard by any other editor, so inexperienced editors cannot accidentally do permanent harm if they make a mistake in their editing.
As there are many more editors intent on improving articles than not, error- ridden articles are usually corrected promptly.

If more pages belong to the category, there will be a link to the next ones.
The categories box for the category page appears at the bottom, in the same place as for other pages.
This contains the categories to which the current category page has been added, i.e.
Add a category page to other categories in the normal way, using the "[[Category: Category name ]]" or "[[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]]" syntax.
A page belongs to a category if the page's wikimarkup contains a declaration for that category.
A category declaration takes the form `[[Category: Category name ]]` or `[[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]]`.
it will not work if it appears between `<nowiki>...</nowiki>` or `<includeonly>...</includeonly>` tags, or in a comment.
The declaration may however come from a transcluded page; see Categories and templates below.
A category name can be any string that would be a legitimate page title.
If the category name begins with a lower-case letter it will be capitalized.
In Wikipedia, it is customary to place category declarations at the end of the wikimarkup, but before any stub templates and interlanguage links.
When a page has been added to one or more categories, a categories box appears at the bottom of the page .
This box contains a list of the categories the page belongs to, in the order in which the category declarations appear in the processed wikimarkup.
The category names are linked to the corresponding category pages.
They appear as redlinks if the corresponding category page does not exist.
If a user has enabled the HotCat gadget, the categories box will also provide links to quickly add, remove, or modify category declarations on the page, without having to edit the whole page.
Hidden categories are not displayed, except as described below under Hiding categories.
The following subsections are ordered from simple actions to more elaborate or rarer actions.
To link to a category page without putting the current page in that category, precede the link with a colon: [[:Category: Category name ]].
Raw information about the members of a category, their sortkeys and timestamps can be obtained from the API, using a query of the form: Listings of up to 500 members are possible.
If there are more members then the results will include text near the end like this: `<categorymembers cmcontinue="page|NNNN|TITLE" />`.
This can be added to the previous one, without quotation marks, for the next page of members: `...&cmcontinue=page|NNNN|TITLE` By default, a page is sorted under the first character of its name, without the namespace.
However, brief periods of an appropriate and reasonable protection level are allowed in situations where blatant vandalism or disruption is occurring and at a level of frequency that requires its use in order to stop it.
The duration of the protection should be set as short as possible, and the protection level should be set to the lowest restriction needed in order to stop the disruption while still allowing productive editors to make changes.
If a deleted page is going through deletion review, only administrators are normally capable of viewing the former content of the page.
If they feel it would benefit the discussion to allow other users to view the page content, administrators may restore the page, blank it or replace the contents with TempUndelete or a similar notice, and fully protect the page to prevent further editing.
The previous contents of the page are then accessible to everyone via the page history.
Generic file names such as File:Map.jpg, File:Photo.jpg, and File:Sound.wav are fully protected to prevent new versions being uploaded.
Administrators cannot change or remove the protection for some areas on Wikipedia which are permanently protected by the MediaWiki software: In addition to hard-coded protection, the following are usually permanently protected: A template-protected page can be edited only by administrators or users in the Template editors group.
This protection level should be used almost exclusively on high-risk templates and modules.
In cases where pages in other namespaces become transcluded to a very high degree, this protection level is also valid.
This is a protection level that replaces full protection on pages that are merely protected due to high transclusion rates, rather than content disputes.
It should be used on templates whose risk factor would have otherwise warranted full protection.
It should not be used on less risky templates on the grounds that the template editor user right exists—the existence of the right should not result in more templates becoming uneditable for the general editing community.
Editors may request edits to a template-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the `{{Edit template-protected}}` template if necessary to gain attention.
Semi-protection prevents edits from unregistered users , as well as edits from any account that is not autoconfirmed or confirmed.
This level of protection is useful when there is a significant amount of disruption or vandalism from new or unregistered users, or to prevent sockpuppets of blocked or banned users from editing, especially when it occurs on biographies of living persons who have had a recent high level of media interest.
An alternative to semi-protection is pending changes, which is sometimes favored when an article is being vandalized regularly, but otherwise receives a low amount of editing.
Such users can request edits to a semi-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the `{{Edit semi-protected}}` template if necessary to gain attention.
If the page in question and its talk page are both protected, please make your edit request at Wikipedia:Request for edit instead.
New users may also request the `confirmed` user right by visiting Requests for permissions.
Administrators may apply indefinite semi-protection to pages that are subject to heavy and persistent vandalism or violations of content policy .
Semi- protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against vandalism that has not yet occurred, nor should it be used to privilege registered users over unregistered users in content disputes.
In addition, administrators may apply temporary semi-protection on pages that are: Today's featured article may be semi-protected just like any other article.
But since that article is subject to sudden spurts of vandalism during certain times of day, administrators should semi-protect it for brief periods in most instances.
For the former guideline, see Wikipedia:Main Page featured article protection.
Administrators can prevent the creation of a page through the protection interface.
This is useful for bad articles that have been deleted but repeatedly recreated.
There are several levels of creation protection that can be applied to pages, identical to the levels for edit protection.
A list of protected titles may be found at Special:Protectedtitles .
Philip Randolph on the March on Washington Movement in 1941 to press for an end to racial discrimination in employment.
Rustin later organized Freedom Rides and helped to organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to strengthen Martin Luther King Jr.'s leadership, teaching King about nonviolence and later serving as an organizer for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
After the passage of the civil rights legislation of 1964–65, Rustin became the head of the AFL–CIO's A.
Philip Randolph Institute, which promoted the integration of formerly all-white unions and promoted the unionization of African Americans.
During the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin served on many humanitarian missions, such as aiding refugees from Communist Vietnam and Cambodia.
At the time of his death in 1987, he was on a humanitarian mission in Haiti.
Rustin was a gay man who had been arrested early in his career for engaging in public sex.
Due to criticism over his sexuality, he usually acted as an influential adviser behind the scenes to civil-rights leaders.
In the 1980s, he became a public advocate on behalf of gay causes.
Later in life, while still devoted to securing workers' rights, Rustin joined other union leaders in aligning with ideological neoconservatism, for which President Ronald Reagan posthumously praised him after his death in 1987.
On November 20, 2013, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded Rustin the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Rustin was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania, to Florence Rustin and Archie Hopkins, but raised by his maternal grandparents, Julia and Janifer Rustin, as the ninth of their twelve children; growing up he believed his biological mother was his older sister.
His grandparents were relatively wealthy local caterers who raised Rustin in a large house.
Julia Rustin was a Quaker, although she attended her husband's African Methodist Episcopal Church.
She was also a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People .
Du Bois and James Weldon Johnson were frequent guests in the Rustin home.
With these influences in his early life, in his youth Rustin campaigned against racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws.
This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter.
Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity.
Involuntary manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness.
Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime, and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, or incapacitation.
In most countries, a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence, possibly a life sentence; and in a few, the death penalty may be imposed.
The modern English word "murder" descends from the Proto-Indo-European "mrtró" which meant "to die".
The Middle English mordre is a noun from Anglo- Saxon morðor and Old French murdre.
Middle English mordre is a verb from Anglo-Saxon myrdrian and the Middle English noun.
In many countries, in news reports, out of concern for being accused of defamation, journalists are generally careful not to identify a suspect as a murderer until the suspect is convicted of homicide.
After arrest, for example, journalists may instead write that the person was "arrested on suspicion of murder", or, after a prosecutor files charges, as an "accused murderer".
The eighteenth-century English jurist William Blackstone , in his Commentaries on the Laws of England set out the common law definition of murder, which by this definition occurs The elements of common law murder are: The four states of mind recognized as constituting "malice" are: Under state of mind , intent to kill, the deadly weapon rule applies.
Thus, if the defendant intentionally uses a deadly weapon or instrument against the victim, such use authorizes a permissive inference of intent to kill.
Examples of deadly weapons and instruments include but are not limited to guns, knives, deadly toxins or chemicals or gases and even vehicles when intentionally used to harm one or more victims.
Under state of mind , an "abandoned and malignant heart", the killing must result from the defendant's conduct involving a reckless indifference to human life and a conscious disregard of an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily injury.
In Australian jurisdictions, the unreasonable risk must amount to a foreseen probability of death , as opposed to possibility.
Under state of mind , the felony-murder doctrine, the felony committed must be an inherently dangerous felony, such as burglary, arson, rape, robbery or kidnapping.
Along with the Vatican City and San Marino, it is one of only three independent states completely surrounded by the territory of another country, and the only one outside of the Italian peninsula.
Lesotho is just over 30,000 km2 in size and has a population of around 2 million.
Lesotho was previously the British Crown Colony of Basutoland, but it declared independence from the United Kingdom on 4 October 1966.
It is now a fully sovereign state that is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Southern African Development Community .
The name Lesotho roughly translates to "the land of the people who speak Sesotho".
The original inhabitants of the area now known as Lesotho were the San people.
Examples of their rock art can be found in the mountains throughout the area.
Modern Lesotho, then called Basutoland, emerged as a single polity under King Moshoeshoe I in 1822.
Moshoeshoe, a son of Mokhachane, a minor chief of the Bakoteli lineage, formed his own clan and became a chief around 1804.
Between 1821 and 1823, he and his followers settled at the Butha-Buthe Mountain, joining with former adversaries in resistance against the Lifaqane associated with the reign of Shaka Zulu from 1818 to 1828.
Further evolution of the state emerged out of conflicts between British and Dutch colonists leaving the Cape Colony following its seizure from the French- allied Dutch by the British in 1795, and also from the Orange River Sovereignty and subsequent Orange Free State.
Missionaries invited by Moshoeshoe I, Thomas Arbousset, Eugène Casalis and Constant Gosselin from the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society, placed at Morija, developed orthography and printed works in the Sesotho language between 1837 and 1855.
Casalis, acting as translator and providing advice on foreign affairs, helped to set up diplomatic channels and acquire guns for use against the encroaching Europeans and the Griqua people.
Trekboers from the Cape Colony arrived on the western borders of Basutoland and claimed rights to its land, the first of which being Jan de Winnaar, who settled in the Matlakeng area in May–June 1838.
As more Boers were moving into the area they tried to colonise the land between the two rivers and even north of the Caledon, claiming that it had been abandoned by the Sotho people.
Moshoeshoe subsequently signed a treaty with the British Governor of the Cape Colony, Sir George Thomas Napier, that annexed the Orange River Sovereignty that many Boers had settled.
These outraged Boers were suppressed in a brief skirmish in 1848.
In 1851 a British force was defeated by the Basotho army at Kolonyama, provoking an embarrassing war for the British.
After repelling another British attack in 1852, Moshoeshoe sent an appeal to the British commander that settled the dispute diplomatically, and then defeated the Batlokoa in 1853.
In 1854 the British pulled out of the region, and in 1858 Moshoeshoe fought a series of wars with the Boers in what is known as the Free State–Basotho War.
As a result Moshoeshoe lost a great portion of the western lowlands.
The last war with the Boers in 1867 ended when Moshoeshoe appealed to Queen Victoria, who agreed to make Basutoland a British protectorate in 1868.
In 1869, the British signed a treaty at Aliwal North with the Boers that defined the boundaries of Basutoland, and later Lesotho.
Wikipedia content is intended to be factual, notable, verifiable with cited external sources, and neutrally presented.
The appropriate policies and guidelines for these are found at: These are often abbreviated to WP:NOT, WP:NPOV, WP:NOR, WP:V, WP:RS, WP:CITE, and WP:MOS respectively.
The Wikipedia community is largely self-organising, so that anyone may build a reputation as a competent editor and become involved in any role s/he may choose, subject to peer approval.
Individuals often will choose to become involved in specialised tasks, such as reviewing articles at others' request, watching current edits for vandalism, watching newly created articles for quality control purposes, or similar roles.
Editors who believe they can serve the community better by taking on additional administrative responsibility may ask their peers for agreement to undertake such responsibilities.
This structure enforces meritocracy and communal standards of editorship and conduct.
At present a minimum approval of 75–80% from the community is required to take on these additional tools and responsibilities.
This standard tends to ensure a high level of experience, trust, and familiarity across a broad front of aspects within Wikipedia.
A variety of software-assisted systems and automated programs help editors and administrators to watch for problematic edits and editors.
Theoretically all editors and users are treated equally with no "power structure".
There is, however, a hierarchy of permissions and positions, some of which are listed hereafter: Wikipedia has a rich set of methods to handle most abuses that commonly arise.
These methods are well-tested and should be relied upon.
In addition, new users may initially find that their votes are given less weight by editors in some informal polls in order to prevent abuse of single- purpose accounts.
As well as systems to catch and control substandard and vandalistic edits, Wikipedia also has a full style and content manual and a variety of positive systems for continual article review and improvement.
Examples of the processes include peer review, good article assessment, and the featured article process, a rigorous review of articles that are intended to meet the highest standards and showcase Wikipedia's capability to produce high-quality work.
In addition, specific types of article or fields often have their own specialized and comprehensive projects, assessment processes , and expert reviewers within specific subjects.
Several of the tabletop games – primarily Vampire: The Masquerade and Hunter: The Reckoning – have been adapted into video games by different developers, covering several genres including role-playing games, action games, and adventure games.
Critical reception of the games has varied, ranging from average to positive, with Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines standing out, being described by video game publications as a cult classic and a "flawed masterpiece".
Video game adaptations of the series began with two Werewolf: The Apocalypse games in the 1990s that were never completed; the first released video game in the series was 2000's Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption , which was followed by three Hunter games in 2002–2003, and Bloodlines in 2004.
Following this, no further World of Darkness video games were released in over a decade, with another Werewolf project and the online game World of Darkness started and canceled in the meantime until 2017's World of Darkness Preludes , which was based on Vampire and Mage: The Ascension.
Since then, several video games have been announced, including Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood and the three Vampire games Coteries of New York , Bloodlines 2 , and Swansong.
Denmark ratified the convention on 25 July 1979, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list.
The first site in Denmark to be added to the list was Jelling Mounds, Runic Stones and Church, inscribed at the 18th Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in 1994 in Phuket, Thailand.
Further sites were added in 1995, 2000, 2004, 2009, 2014, 2017, and 2018.
As of 2019, Denmark has ten sites inscribed on the list and a further four on the tentative list.
Three sites, Kujataa, Aasivissuit – Nipisat, and Ilulissat Icefjord, are located in Greenland, which is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark.
Seven sites in Denmark are cultural and three are natural.
The natural site Wadden Sea is shared with Germany and the Netherlands.
In 2014, the Danish part of the site was added to the existing site in the other two countries, listed in 2009.
UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria.
Criteria i through vi are cultural, whereas vii through x are natural.
In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage list, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination.
Nominations for the World Heritage list are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list.
As of 2019[update], Denmark has recorded four sites on its tentative list.
, a 1997 educational film co-produced by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, before making appearances in minor television roles in the early 2000s.
Evans has described his filmography of the early to mid 2000s as being "really terrible." He appeared in the television comedy- drama Opposite Sex , comedies Not Another Teen Movie and The Perfect Score , and the action thriller Cellular .
In 2005, Evans had his breakthrough performance as Johnny Storm / Human Torch in the superhero film Fantastic Four , his highest-paid role at the time, and reprised the role for the film's 2007 sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.
Fantastic Four would be the first of many roles in films adapted from comic books and graphic novels for Evans, including Casey Jones in TMNT , Jake Jensen in The Losers , Lucas Lee in Scott Pilgrim vs.
His most prolific comic book movie role would be as Steve Rogers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe series of films, with credited appearances and cameos as the character in eleven films and one video game; notable appearances include the headlining films Captain America: The First Avenger , Captain America: The Winter Soldier , and Captain America: Civil War , and the ensemble films The Avengers , Avengers: Age of Ultron , Avengers: Infinity War , and Avengers: Endgame .
While comic book films formed the bulk of Evans' filmography from the late 2000s through the entirety of the 2010s, he concurrently acted in a range of non-comic book projects including Danny Boyle's psychological thriller Sunshine , the film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond , and Marc Webb's drama Gifted .
He also starred in several romantic comedy films, including The Nanny Diaries , What's Your Number?
, and Playing It Cool , the latter of which he also executive produced.
Evans made his directorial debut in 2014 with the romantic drama Before We Go , which he also produced and starred in.
His Broadway debut was in the 2018 revival of Kenneth Lonergan's play Lobby Hero , for which he was nominated for a Drama League Award.
He received critical acclaim for playing a rebellious scion in Rian Johnson's Knives Out .
English Wikipedia groups accented characters together with their unaccented version, so pages starting with À, Á, Ä, will be listed under heading A.
Sorting is case-insensitive, so "ABC" comes after "Abacus".
Unlike at Special:Allpages and Special:Prefixindex, a space is treated as a space , not as an underscore.
The English Wikipedia has numerical sorting in categories.
This means a page whose title begins with a number will be sorted according to the numeric value of the number .
Thus "9 dogs", "25 dogs", and "112 dogs" will all appear under the "0–9" heading in numeric order.
If the number includes a comma, space, or period, the sorting algorithm will only consider the part of the number before the separator.
Each of the three lists is arranged in the order explained above .
If an item ought to be positioned within a list on the basis of an alternative name for that item, then this can be specified in the category tag that places the item in the list: For example, to add an article called Albert Einstein to the category "People" and have the article sorted by "Einstein, Albert", you would type: Unlike a piped link , the sort key itself is not displayed to readers.
It affects only the order in which pages are listed on the category page.
It is useful to document the system being used for sort keys on the category page.
For guidelines about the use of sort keys on Wikipedia, see WP:SORTKEY.
It is possible to set a default sort key which is different from PAGENAME by using the magic word DEFAULTSORT: In the case of multiple default sort key tags, the last DEFAULTSORT on the final rendering of a page applies for all categories, regardless of the position of the category tags.
This also means that a DEFAULTSORT tag included from a template is not effective if another DEFAULTSORT tag occurs later on the page, even if the later DEFAULTSORT tag is also "hidden" .
In addition to browsing through hierarchies of categories, it is possible to use the search tool to find specific articles in specific categories.
To search for articles in a specific category, type incategory:" CategoryName " in the search box.
An "OR" can be added to join the contents of one category with the contents of another.
For example, enter to return all pages that belong to either of the categories, as here.
Note that using search to find categories will not find articles which have been categorized using templates.
This feature also doesn't return pages in subcategories.
Special:Categories provides an alphabetic list of all categories, with the number of members of each; this number does not include the content of the subcategories, but it includes the subcategories themselves, i.e., each counting as one.
The above list contains all categories that have members, regardless of whether they have corresponding category pages.
To list all existing category pages , use Special:AllPages/Category:.
As described at mw:Help:Magic words,  Example  or  Example  returns the number of pages in "Category:Example".
Each subcategory counts as one page; pages in subcategories are not counted.
The page Special:CategoryTree enables you to see the tree structure of a category .
The CategoryTree extension can be used to display such a tree on any page.
The basic syntax is to display just the subcategory tree, and to display member pages as well.
Dapete's category-visualizer vCat will render charts of the tree structure.
You may also use Template:Category tree or Template:Category tree all, instead.
Warning: Categories can be moved in the same way as an ordinary page; but a certain amount of cleanup may be necessary.
A redirect is left at the old category name, and this is not a normal `#REDIRECT [[...]]` but a category redirect.
Once all the pages have been moved out of the old category, it may be left as a category redirect or deleted.
Pre-emptive restrictions on new article titles are instituted through the title blacklist system, which allows for more flexible protection with support for substrings and regular expressions.
Pages that have been creation-protected are sometimes referred to as "salted".
Contributors wishing to re-create a salted title with appropriate content should either contact an administrator , file a request at Wikipedia:Requests for page protection, or use the deletion review process.
To make a convincing case for re-creation, it is helpful to show a draft version of the intended article when filing a request.
Administrators should choose the appropriate level of create protection—autoconfirmed, extended-confirmed, or full.
Due to the implementation of ACPERM, non-confirmed editors cannot create pages in mainspace; thus, semi-creation protection should be rare, used only for protection of pages outside of mainspace.
While creation-protection is usually permanent, temporary creation protection may be applied if a page is repeatedly recreated by a single user .
Move protected pages, or more technically, fully move-protected pages, cannot be moved to a new title except by an administrator.
Move protection is commonly applied to: Fully edit-protected pages are also implicitly move-protected.
As with full edit protection, protection because of edit warring should not be considered an endorsement of the current name.
When move protection is applied during a requested move discussion, the page should be protected at the location it was at when the move request was started.
All files are implicitly move-protected; only file movers and administrators can move files.
Upload protected files, or more technically, fully upload-protected files, cannot be replaced with new versions except by an administrator.
Upload protection does not protect file pages from editing.
Upload protection may be applied by an administrator to: As with full edit protection, administrators should avoid favoring one file version over another, and protection should not be considered an endorsement of the current file version.
An obvious exception to this rule is when files are protected due to upload vandalism.
Pending changes protection is a tool used to suppress vandalism and certain other persistent problems while allowing all users to continue to submit edits.
Pending changes protection can be used as an alternative to semi- protection to allow unregistered and new users to edit pages, while keeping the edits hidden from the view of most readers until those changes are accepted by a reviewer.
When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an unregistered editor or a new user, the edit is not directly visible to the majority of Wikipedia readers, until it is reviewed and accepted by an editor with the pending changes reviewer right.
When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an autoconfirmed user, the edit will be immediately visible to Wikipedia readers.
Pending changes are visible in the page history, where they are marked as pending review.
Readers not logged in are shown the latest accepted version of the page; logged-in users see the latest version of the page, with all changes applied.
When editors who are not reviewers make changes to an article with unreviewed pending changes, their edits are also marked as pending and are not visible to most readers.
A user who clicks "edit this page" is always, at that point, shown the latest version of the page for editing regardless of whether the user is logged in or not.
Reviewing of pending changes should be resolved within reasonable time limits.
Pending changes may be used to protect articles against: Pending changes protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against violations that have not yet occurred.
Like semi-protection, PC protection should never be used in genuine content disputes, where there is a risk of placing a particular group of editors at a disadvantage.
Pending changes protection should not be used on articles with a very high edit rate, even if they meet the aforementioned criteria.
In addition, administrators may apply temporary pending changes protection on pages that are subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption when blocking individual users is not a feasible option.
As with other forms of protection, the time frame of the protection should be proportional to the problem.
Indefinite PC protection should be used only in cases of severe long-term disruption.
Removal of pending changes protection can be requested of any administrator, or at requests for unprotection.
The reviewing process is described in detail at Wikipedia:Reviewing pending changes.
In the sport of cricket, a century is a score of one hundred or more runs by a batsman in a single innings.
Privacy law refers to the laws that deal with the regulation, storing, and using of personally identifiable information of individuals, which can be collected by governments, public or private organisations, or other individuals.
One of the first documented realizations Rustin had of his sexuality was when he mentioned to his grandmother that he preferred to spend time with males rather than females.
She responded, "I suppose that's what you need to do." In 1932, Rustin entered Wilberforce University, a historically black college in Ohio operated by the AME Church.
As a student at Wilberforce, Rustin was active in a number of campus organizations, including the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.
He was expelled from Wilberforce in 1936 after organizing a strike, and later attended Cheyney State Teachers College .
Cheyney honored Rustin with a posthumous "Doctor of Humane Letters" degree at its 2013 commencement.
After completing an activist training program conducted by the American Friends Service Committee , Rustin moved to Harlem in 1937 and began studying at City College of New York.
There he became involved in efforts to defend and free the Scottsboro Boys, nine young black men in Alabama who were accused of raping two white women.
He joined the Young Communist League for a small period of time in 1936, before becoming disillusioned with the party.
Soon after arriving in New York City, he became a member of Fifteenth Street Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends .
Rustin was an accomplished tenor vocalist, an asset which earned him admission to both Wilberforce University and Cheyney State Teachers College with music scholarships.
In 1939, he was in the chorus of a short-lived musical that starred Paul Robeson.
Blues singer Josh White was also a cast member, and later invited Rustin to join his band, "Josh White and the Carolinians".
This gave Rustin the opportunity to become a regular performer at the Café Society nightclub in Greenwich Village, widening his social and intellectual contacts.
A few albums on Fellowship Records featuring his singing were produced from the 1950s through the 1970s.
Rustin's personal philosophy is said to have been inspired by combining Quaker pacifism with socialism and the theory of non-violent protest, popularized by Mahatma Gandhi.
At the direction of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party USA and its members were active in the civil rights movement for African Americans.
The CPUSA, at the time following Stalin's "theory of nationalism", favored the creation of a separate nation for African-Americans to be located in the American Southeast where the greatest proportion of the black population was concentrated.
In 1941, after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Communist International ordered the CPUSA to abandon civil rights work and focus on supporting U.S.
Disillusioned, Rustin began working with members of the Socialist Party of Norman Thomas, particularly A.
Philip Randolph, the head of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; another socialist mentor was the pacifist A.
Muste, leader of the Fellowship of Reconciliation .
FOR hired Rustin as a race relation secretary in the late summer of 1941.
The three of them proposed a march on Washington in 1941 to protest racial segregation in the armed forces and widespread discrimination in employment.
Meeting with President Roosevelt in the Oval Office, Randolph respectfully and politely, but firmly told President Roosevelt that African Americans would march in the capital unless desegregation occurred.
Importantly, the underlying felony cannot be a lesser included offense such as assault, otherwise all criminal homicides would be murder as all are felonies.
In Spanish criminal law, murder takes place when any of these requirements concur: Treachery , price or reward or viciousness .
After the last reform of the Spanish Criminal Code, in force since July 1, 2015, another circumstance that turns homicide into murder is the desire to facilitate the commission of another crime or to prevent it from being discovered.
As with most legal terms, the precise definition of murder varies between jurisdictions and is usually codified in some form of legislation.
Even when the legal distinction between murder and manslaughter is clear, it is not unknown for a jury to find a murder defendant guilty of the lesser offense.
The jury might sympathize with the defendant , and the jury may wish to protect the defendant from a sentence of life imprisonment or execution.
The distinction between first- and second-degree murder exists, for example, in Canadian murder law and U.S.
The most common division is between first- and second-degree murder.
Generally, second-degree murder is common law murder, and first-degree is an aggravated form.
The aggravating factors of first-degree murder depend on the jurisdiction, but may include a specific intent to kill, premeditation, or deliberation.
In some, murder committed by acts such as strangulation, poisoning, or lying in wait are also treated as first-degree murder.
further distinguish third-degree murder, but they differ significantly in which kinds of murders they classify as second-degree versus third-degree.
For example, Minnesota defines third-degree murder as depraved- heart murder, whereas Florida defines third-degree murder as felony murder .
Some jurisdictions also distinguish premeditated murder.
This is the crime of wrongfully and intentionally causing the death of another human being after rationally considering the timing or method of doing so, in order to either increase the likelihood of success, or to evade detection or apprehension.
State laws in the United States vary as to definitions of "premeditation".
In some states, premeditation may be construed as taking place mere seconds before the murder.
This treaty effectively reduced Moshoeshoe's kingdom to half its previous size by ceding away the western territories of Basutoland.
Following the cession in 1869, the British transferred functions from Moshoeshoe's capital in Thaba Bosiu to a police camp on the northwest border, Maseru, until eventually the administration of Basutoland was transferred to the Cape Colony in 1871.
Moshoeshoe died on 11 March 1870, marking the end of the traditional era and the beginning of the colonial era of Basutoland.
In the early years of British rule between 1871 and 1884, Basutoland was treated similarly to other territories that had been forcibly annexed, much to the humiliation of the Basotho, leading to a Gun War in 1881.
In 1884, Basutoland was restored to its status as a protectorate, with Maseru again its capital, but remained under direct rule by a governor, though effective internal power was wielded by traditional chiefs.
Basutoland gained its independence from Britain and became the Kingdom of Lesotho in 1966.
In January 1970, the ruling Basotho National Party lost the first post- independence general elections, with 23 seats to the Basutoland Congress Party's 36.
Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan refused to cede power to the Basotho Congress Party , and instead declared himself Tona Kholo , and imprisoned the BCP leadership.
BCP began a rebellion and then received training in Libya for its Lesotho Liberation Army under the pretense of being Azanian People's Liberation Army soldiers of the Pan Africanist Congress .
Deprived of arms and supplies by the Sibeko faction of the PAC in 1978, the 178-strong LLA was rescued from their Tanzanian base by the financial assistance of a Maoist PAC officer, but they launched the guerrilla war with only a handful of old weapons.
The main force was defeated in northern Lesotho, and later guerrillas launched sporadic but usually ineffectual attacks.
The campaign was severely compromised when BCP's leader, Ntsu Mokhehle, went to Pretoria.
In the early 1980s, several Basotho who sympathised with the exiled BCP were threatened with death and attacked by the government of Leabua Jonathan.
On 4 September 1981, the family of Benjamin Masilo was attacked.
Exactly four days later, Edgar Mahlomola Motuba, the editor of the popular newspaper Leselinyana la Lesotho, was abducted from his home together with two friends and murdered.
What later ensued was a de facto government led by Dr.
Leabua Jonathan until 1986 when a military coup forced it out of office.
The Transitional Military Council that came to power granted executive powers to King Moshoeshoe II, who was until then a ceremonial monarch.
But in 1987 the King was forced into exile after coming up with a six-page memorandum on how he wanted the Lesotho's constitution to be, which would have given him more executive powers than the military government had originally agreed to.
His son was installed as King Letsie III in his place.
The chairman of the military junta, Major General Justin Metsing Lekhanya, was ousted in 1991 and replaced by Major General Elias Phisoana Ramaema, who handed over power to a democratically elected government of the BCP in 1993.
Moshoeshoe II returned from exile in 1992 as an ordinary citizen.
After the return to democratic government, King Letsie III tried unsuccessfully to persuade the BCP government to reinstate his father as head of state.
In August 1994, Letsie III staged a military-backed coup that deposed the BCP government, after the BCP government refused to reinstate his father, Moshoeshoe II, according to Lesotho's constitution.
The new government did not receive full international recognition.
Member states of the Southern African Development Community engaged in negotiations to reinstate the BCP government.

Wikipedia (/ˌwɪkɪˈpiːdiə/ (![About this sound], /ˌwɪkiˈpiːdiə/ (![About this sound] is a multilingual, web-based, free-content encyclopedia project supported by the Wikimedia Foundation and based on a model of openly editable content.
This is a tracking category for disambiguation pages.
Contains pages with short descriptions defined on Wikipedia by short description.
The name "Wikipedia" is a portmanteau of the words wiki and encyclopedia.
Wikipedia's articles provide links designed to guide the user to related pages with additional information.
Wikipedia is written collaboratively by largely anonymous volunteers who write without pay.
Anyone with Internet access can write and make changes to Wikipedia articles, except in limited cases where editing is restricted to prevent disruption or vandalism.
Users can contribute anonymously, under a pseudonym, or, if they choose to, with their real identity.
The fundamental principles by which Wikipedia operates are the five pillars.
The Wikipedia community has developed many policies and guidelines to improve the encyclopedia; however, it is not a formal requirement to be familiar with them before contributing.
Since its creation on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has grown rapidly into one of the largest reference websites, attracting 374 million unique visitors monthly as of September 2015[update].
There are about 68,000 active contributors working on more than 48,000,000 articles in 302 languages.
As of today, there are 6,009,373 articles in English.
Every day, hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world collectively make tens of thousands of edits and create thousands of new articles to augment the knowledge held by the Wikipedia encyclopedia.
People of all ages, cultures and backgrounds can add or edit article prose, references, images and other media here.
What is contributed is more important than the expertise or qualifications of the contributor.
What will remain depends upon whether the content is free of copyright restrictions and contentious material about living people, and whether it fits within Wikipedia's policies, including being verifiable against a published reliable source, thereby excluding editors' opinions and beliefs and unreviewed research.
Contributions cannot damage Wikipedia because the software allows easy reversal of mistakes and many experienced editors are watching to help ensure that edits are cumulative improvements.
Begin by simply clicking the Edit link at the top of any editable page!
Wikipedia is a live collaboration differing from paper-based reference sources in important ways.
Unlike printed encyclopedias, Wikipedia is continually created and updated, with articles on historic events appearing within minutes, rather than months or years.
Because everybody can help improve it, Wikipedia has become more comprehensive than any other encyclopedia.
In addition to quantity, its contributors work on improving quality as well.
Wikipedia is a work-in-progress, with articles in various stages of completion.
As articles develop, they tend to become more comprehensive and balanced.
Quality also improves over time as misinformation and other errors are removed or repaired.
However, because anyone can click "edit" at any time and add content, any article may contain undetected misinformation, errors, or vandalism.
Awareness of this helps the reader to obtain valid information, avoid recently added misinformation , and fix the article.
See also: Wikipedia:FAQ and Wikipedia:Citing Wikipedia Wikipedia was founded as an offshoot of Nupedia, a now-abandoned project to produce a free encyclopedia, begun by the online media company Bomis.
Nupedia had an elaborate system of peer review and required highly qualified contributors, but the writing of articles was slow.
During 2000, Jimmy Wales , and Larry Sanger, whom Wales had employed to work on the encyclopedia project, discussed ways of supplementing Nupedia with a more open, complementary project.
Multiple sources suggested that a wiki might allow members of the public to contribute material, and Nupedia's first wiki went online on January 10, 2001.
There was considerable resistance on the part of Nupedia's editors and reviewers to the idea of associating Nupedia with a website in the wiki format, so the new project was given the name "Wikipedia" and launched on its own domain, wikipedia.com, on January 15 .
Other current and past Bomis employees who have worked on the project include Tim Shell, one of the cofounders of Bomis and its current CEO, and programmer Jason Richey.
In May 2001, a large number of non-English Wikipedias were launched—in Catalan, Chinese, Dutch, Esperanto, French, German, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, and Swedish.
In September, Polish was added, and further commitment to the multilingual provision of Wikipedia was made.
It enables us to use All article disambiguation pages to get the exact number of disambiguation pages in the main namespace.
Pages are put in this category by templates such as Disambiguationand {{Airport disambiguation}}.
That is, templates built with the dmboxmeta- template, which is doing the actual categorising.
Disambiguation in Wikipedia is the process of resolving the conflicts that occur when articles about two or more different topics could have the same "natural" page title.
Wikipedia is built around/with the principle that anyone can edit it, and it therefore aims to have as many of its pages as possible open for public editing so that anyone can add material and correct errors.
Disambiguation pages on Wikipedia are used as a process of resolving conflicts in article titles that occur when a single term can be associated with more than one topic, making that term likely to be the natural title for more than one article.
In other words, disambiguations are paths leading to different articles which could, in principle, have the same title.
For example, the word "Mercury" can refer to several different things, including an element, a planet, and a Roman god.
Since only one Wikipedia page can have the generic name "Mercury", unambiguous article titles are used for each of these topics: Mercury , Mercury , Mercury .
There must then be a way to direct the reader to the correct specific article when the ambiguous word "Mercury" is referenced by linking, browsing or searching; this is what is known as disambiguation.
In this case it is achieved using Mercury as the title of a disambiguation page.
There are three principal disambiguation scenarios, of which the following are examples: Occasionally a reader may follow a link that ends up at a disambiguation page rather than at one of the links shown on that page.
The original page can be edited to link directly to its intended destination.
Feel free to make such edits; everyone is welcome to improve Wikipedia, including you.
It could be you who makes the overall experience of Wikipedia that much better.
At the end of the year, Afrikaans, Norwegian, and Serbo-Croatian versions were announced.
The domain was eventually changed to the present wikipedia.org when the not- for-profit Wikimedia Foundation was launched, in 2003, as its new parent organization, with the ".org" top-level domain denoting its non-commercial nature.
Anyone with Web access can edit Wikipedia, and this openness encourages inclusion of a tremendous amount of content.
About 70,000 editors—from expert scholars to casual readers—regularly edit Wikipedia, and these experienced editors often help to create a consistent style throughout the encyclopedia, following our Manual of Style.
Several mechanisms are in place to help Wikipedia members carry out the important work of crafting a high-quality resource while maintaining civility.
Editors are able to watch pages and technically skilled persons can write editing programs to keep track of or rectify bad edits.
Where there are disagreements on how to display facts, editors often work together to compile an article that fairly represents current expert opinion on the subject.
Aspiring authors may wish to read the information on Contributing to Wikipedia before contributing to the project.
Although the Wikimedia Foundation owns the site, it is largely uninvolved in writing and daily operations.
"Wikipedia" is a registered trademark of the not-for-profit Wikimedia Foundation, which has created a family of free-content projects that are built by user contributions.
Most of Wikipedia's text and many of its images are dual-licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution-Sharealike 3.0 Unported License and the GNU Free Documentation License .
Some text has been imported only under CC-BY-SA and CC-BY-SA-compatible license and cannot be reused under GFDL; such text is identified either on the page footer, in the page history or on the discussion page of the article that utilizes the text.
Every image has a description page that indicates the license under which it is released or, if it is non-free, the rationale under which it is used.
Contributions remain the property of their creators, while the CC-BY-SA and GFDL licenses ensure the content is freely distributable and reproducible.
Text on Wikipedia is a collaborative work, and the efforts of individual contributors to a page are recorded in that page's history, which is publicly viewable.
Information on the authorship of images and other media, such as sound files, can be found by clicking on the image itself or the nearby information icon to display the file page, which includes the author and source, where appropriate, along with other information.
Many visitors come to Wikipedia to acquire knowledge, while others come to share knowledge.
At this very instant, dozens of articles are being improved, and new articles are also being created.
Changes can be viewed at the Recent changes page and a random page at random articles.
Over 5,600 articles have been designated by the Wikipedia community as featured articles, exemplifying the best articles in the encyclopedia.
Another 30,000 articles are designated as good articles.
Some information on Wikipedia is organized into lists; the best of these are designated as featured lists.
Categories are intended to group together pages on similar subjects.
Michel Bernard Barnier is a French politician serving as the European Commission's Head of Task Force for Relations with the United Kingdom since November 2019.
This category contains disambiguation pages : non- article pages containing links to other Wikipedia articles and disambiguation pages.
Disambiguation pages are added to Category:Disambiguation pages by placing the Disambiguationtemplate on the page itself.
Other templates are available that place articles in more specific disambiguation subcategories.
A page may also be assessed as "disambiguation-class" by various WikiProjects by including "|class=Disambig" in a WikiProject template on the talk page of the disambiguation page.
This places the talk page in a subcategory of Category:Disambig-Class articles.
Lists of disambiguation pages: Disambiguation pages can include links to Wiktionary, using wiktionary.
However, in some particular circumstances, because of a specifically identified likelihood of damage resulting if editing is left open, some individual pages may need to be subject to technical restrictions on who is permitted to modify them.
The placing of such restrictions on pages is called protection.
Protection can be applied to or removed from pages only by Wikipedia's administrators, although any user may request protection.
Protection can be indefinite or expire after a specified time period.
The most commonly used types of protection are full protection , which means that a page can be modified only by administrators; and semi- protection , which means that a page can be modified only by users who are logged in and whose accounts have been confirmed .
Protected pages are marked with a small padlock icon in the top right corner of the article page; different color padlocks represent different protection types, as shown in the images at the right.
The template `{{pp-protected}}` is usually placed on protected pages to display the padlock.
Even when protected, the source code of the page can still be viewed and copied by any user.
Placing the mouse pointer over a padlock icon produces an informational tooltip saying "This article is protected." If the padlock template's 'reason' parameter is specified, the tooltip also says why the page is protected.
If the 'expiry' parameter is specified, the tooltip says for what duration the page is protected.
This policy explains in detail the protection types and procedures for page protection and unprotection and the reasons for which protection should and should not be applied.
The following technical options are available to administrators for protecting different actions to pages: The following technical options are available to administrators for adding protection levels to the different actions to pages: Any type of protection may be requested at Wikipedia:Requests for page protection.
Changes to a fully protected page should be proposed on the corresponding talk page, and carried out by an administrator if they are uncontroversial or if there is consensus for them.
Except in the case of office actions , Arbitration Committee remedies, or pages in the MediaWiki namespace , administrators may unprotect a page if the reason for its protection no longer applies, a reasonable period has elapsed, and there is no consensus that continued protection is necessary.
Editors desiring the unprotection of a page should, in the first instance, ask the administrator who applied the protection unless the administrator is inactive or no longer an administrator; thereafter, requests may be made at Requests for unprotection.
Note that such requests will normally be declined if the protecting administrator is active and was not consulted first.
A log of protections and unprotections is available at Special:Log/protect.
A fully protected page can be edited or moved only by administrators.
The protection may be for a specified time or may be indefinite.
Modifications to a fully protected page can be proposed on its talk page for discussion.
Administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting consensus.
Placing the Edit fully protected template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.
Content disputes and edit warring may be addressed with blocks issued by uninvolved administrators while allowing normal page editing by other editors.
Under the protection policy, an alternative approach is available as administrators have the discretion to temporarily fully protect an article to end an ongoing edit war.
This approach may be better suited to multi-party disputes and contentious content as talk page consensus becomes a requirement for implementation of requested edits.
When protecting a page because of a content dispute, administrators have a duty to avoid protecting a version that contains policy-violating content, such as vandalism, copyright violations, defamation, or poor-quality coverage of living people.
Administrators remain uninvolved when exercising their discretion, subject to this proviso, to decide whether to apply protection to the most current version of an article, or to an older, stable, or pre-edit- war version.
Protected pages may not be edited except to make changes that are uncontroversial or for which there is clear consensus.
Editors convinced that the protected version of an article contains policy-violating content, or that protection has rewarded edit warring or disruption by establishing a contentious revision, may identify a stable version prior to the edit war and request reversion to that version.
Before making such a request, editors should consider how independent editors might view the suggestion and recognize that continuing an edit war is grounds for being blocked.
Administrators who have made substantive content changes to an article are considered involved and must not use their advanced permissions to further their own positions.
When involved in a dispute, it is almost always wisest to respect the editing policies that bind all editors and call for input from an uninvolved administrator, rather than to invite controversy by acting unilaterally.
Applying page protection as a preemptive measure is contrary to the open nature of Wikipedia and is generally not allowed if applied for these reasons.
However, brief periods of an appropriate and reasonable protection level are allowed in situations where blatant vandalism or disruption is occurring and at a level of frequency that requires its use in order to stop it.
The duration of the protection should be set as short as possible, and the protection level should be set to the lowest restriction needed in order to stop the disruption while still allowing productive editors to make changes.
If a deleted page is going through deletion review, only administrators are normally capable of viewing the former content of the page.
If they feel it would benefit the discussion to allow other users to view the page content, administrators may restore the page, blank it or replace the contents with TempUndelete or a similar notice, and fully protect the page to prevent further editing.
The previous contents of the page are then accessible to everyone via the page history.
Wikipedia also has portals, which organize content around topic areas.
Articles can be found using the search box on the top-right side of the screen.
Wikipedia is available in languages other than English.
Wikipedia has more than two hundred and eighty languages, including a Simple English version, and related projects include a dictionary, quotations, books, manuals, and scientific reference sources, and a news service .
All these are maintained, updated, and managed by separate communities, and often include information and articles that can be hard to find through other common sources.
Wikipedia articles are all linked, or cross-referenced.
When highlighted text like this is seen, it means there is a link to some relevant article or Wikipedia page with further in-depth information.
Holding the mouse over the link will often show to where the link will lead.
There are other links towards the ends of most articles, for other articles of interest, relevant external websites and pages, reference material, and organized categories of knowledge which can be searched and traversed in a loose hierarchy for more information.
Some articles may also have links to dictionary definitions, audio-book readings, quotations, the same article in other languages, and further information available on our sister projects.
Additional links can be easily made if a relevant link is missing—this is one simple way to contribute.
As wiki documents, articles are never considered complete and may be continually edited and improved.
Over time, this generally results in an upward trend of quality and a growing consensus over a neutral representation of information.
Users should be aware that not all articles are of encyclopedic quality from the start: they may contain false or debatable information.
Indeed, many articles start their lives as displaying a single viewpoint; and, after a long process of discussion, debate, and argumentation, they gradually take on a neutral point of view reached through consensus.
Others may, for a while, become caught up in a heavily unbalanced viewpoint which can take some time—months or years perhaps—to achieve a better balanced coverage of their subject.
In part, this is because editors often contribute content in which they have a particular interest and do not attempt to make each article they edit comprehensive.
However, eventually, additional editors expand and contribute to articles and strive to achieve balance and comprehensive coverage.
In addition, Wikipedia operates a number of internal resolution processes that can assist when editors disagree on content and approach.
Usually, editors eventually reach a consensus on ways to improve the article.
The ideal Wikipedia article is well written, balanced, neutral, and encyclopedic, containing comprehensive, notable, verifiable knowledge.
An increasing number of articles reach this standard over time, and many already have.
Our best articles are called Featured Articles , and our second best tier of articles are designated Good Articles.
However, this is a process and can take months or years to be achieved through the concerted effort of editors.
I do some New Pages Patrol and occasionally come across someone who has copyrighted material he or she would like to donate to Wikipedia.
I'd like to direct such people to WP:Donating copyrighted materials, the intuitive shortcut to which is WP:DONATE, which redirects to the Donors subpage.
I'm not saying we should redirect the shortcut over there since the subpage does make more sense as a target, but I do think a hatnote to the effect of "'WP:DONATE' redirects here.
You may be looking for WP:Donating copyrighted materials." should be placed at the top of the Donors subpage.
I am aware of the actual shortcuts to Donating copyrighted materials and use them, but one can't generally guess them without looking at the page itself.

They are implemented by a MediaWiki feature that adds any page with a text like `[[Category: XYZ ]]` in its wikimarkup to the automated listing that is the category with name XYZ.
Categories help readers to find, and navigate around, a subject area, to see pages sorted by title, and to thus find article relationships.
Categories are normally found at the bottom of an article page.
Clicking a category name brings up a category page listing the articles that have been added to that particular category.
There may also be a section listing the subcategories of that category.
The subcategorization feature makes it possible to organize categories into tree-like structures to aid navigation.
The term category does refer to both the title of a category page—the category pagename —and the category itself.
Keeping this in mind while reading about categorization, plus learning a category page layout is a worthwhile investment in research techniques.
The layout of a category page is mostly text, but see about displaying category trees below.
The MediaWiki software maintains tables of categories , to which any editable page can be added.
To add a page to a category, include "`[[Category: Category name ]]`" or "`[[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]]`" in that page's wikimarkup.
The categories to which a page belongs appear in a box at the bottom of the page.
A category is usually associated with a category page in the "Category:" namespace.
A category page contains text that can be edited, like any other page, but when the page is displayed, the last part of what is displayed is an automatically generated list of all pages in that category, in the form of links.
Other category pages which appear in this list are treated separately, as subcategories.
A category page is any page in the Category namespace.
They each act as a category, and are termed a "category".
The category page has one section titled Subcategories listing other "categories", and one section titled Pages , listing pages as categorized .
New categories are created by creating a page in the Category namespace.
However, when it is displayed, the editable part of the page is followed by automatically generated lists of pages belonging to the category, as follows: The items in the lists all link to the pages concerned; in the case of the images this applies both to the image itself and to the text below it .
For the way in which the lists are ordered, see Sorting category pages below.
The first and second lists are divided into sections, according to the first character of the sort key.
He previously served as Chief Negotiator \- Task Force for the Preparation and Conduct of the Negotiations with the United Kingdom under Article 50 TEU from October 2016 to November 2019.
He has served in several French cabinet positions including minister of foreign affairs from 2004 to 2005, minister of state for European affairs from 1995 to 1997 and minister of the environment and way of life from 1993 to 1995.
He served at European level as European Commissioner for Regional Policy and European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services , and was vice president of the European People's Party from 2010 to 2015.
Barnier was appointed minister for agriculture in the Government of France on 18 June 2007, stepping down on 7 June 2009 upon his election as a Member of the European Parliament .
He served as European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services under Barroso.
On 1 October 2016, the European Commission appointed him as its chief Brexit negotiator under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union .
Barnier was born at La Tronche in the French Alps, into a Gaullist family in 1951.
Barnier graduated from the ESCP Europe business school in 1972.
Barnier served on the staff of various Gaullist ministers in the 1970s, before being elected in 1978, aged 27, to the French National Assembly as deputy for the Department of Savoie representing the neo-Gaullists, Rally for the Republic , serving until 1993.
Together with Jean-Claude Killy he organised the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville as co-president of the COJO .
Barnier first joined the French Cabinet as Minister of the Environment following the Right's landslide victory in the 1993 legislative election.
In 1995, Jacques Chirac appointed him secretary of state for European affairs, serving as such until the defeat of the presidential majority in the 1997 legislative election.
Barnier then served as a European Commissioner for Regional Policy in the Prodi Commission from 1999 until 31 March 2004.
Then he served as Foreign Minister of France in Jean-Pierre Raffarin's government until 5 June 2005 when Dominique de Villepin replaced him with Philippe Douste-Blazy.
He considered he was unjustly sanctioned for the victory of the "No" in the French referendum over the European Constitution.
In March 2006, Barnier was elected vice president of the European People's Party for a three-year term.
Under Nicolas Sarkozy's presidency, upon the reshuffle of the French cabinet, caused by the resignation of Alain Juppé after the 2007 French legislative election, he re-joined the French Cabinet as Minister of Agriculture.
In 2016, the French investigating judge Sabine Kheris requested that the case of Michel Barnier, Dominique de Villepin and Michèle Alliot-Marie be referred to the Court of Justice of the Republic.
These former ministers were suspected of having allowed the exfiltration of the mercenaries responsible for the attack on the Bouaké camp in 2004, killing nine French soldiers.
The operation was allegedly intended to justify a response operation against the Laurent Gbagbo government in the context of the 2004 crisis in Ivory Coast.
Barnier worked in 2006 as a special adviser to José Manuel Barroso, the then President of the European Commission, and presented a report to the Council of Ministers proposing the creation of a European civil-protection force.
In 2006–2007, he served as member of the Amato Group, a group of high-level European politicians unofficially working on rewriting the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe into what became known as the Treaty of Lisbon following its rejection by French and Dutch voters.
Barnier led the UMP list in Ile-de-France for the 2009 European Parliament election.
In February 2010 he was confirmed as European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services.
In charge of European banking system reform, he argues for a "coherent single market with intelligent rules that apply everywhere".
He was twice appointed Acting Commissioner for Industry and Entrepreneurship in Antonio Tajani's stead, from 19 April 2014 to 25 May 2014 while he was on electoral campaign leave for the 2014 elections to the European Parliament and from 1 July 2014 to 16 July 2014 after he took up his seat.
As European Commissioner for Internal Market and Services, Barnier handled many important issues, such as the reform of the financial sector , the banking union and the digital single market.
Generic file names such as File:Map.jpg, File:Photo.jpg, and File:Sound.wav are fully protected to prevent new versions being uploaded.
Administrators cannot change or remove the protection for some areas on Wikipedia which are permanently protected by the MediaWiki software: In addition to hard-coded protection, the following are usually permanently protected: A template-protected page can be edited only by administrators or users in the Template editors group.
This protection level should be used almost exclusively on high-risk templates and modules.
In cases where pages in other namespaces become transcluded to a very high degree, this protection level is also valid.
This is a protection level that replaces full protection on pages that are merely protected due to high transclusion rates, rather than content disputes.
It should be used on templates whose risk factor would have otherwise warranted full protection.
It should not be used on less risky templates on the grounds that the template editor user right exists—the existence of the right should not result in more templates becoming uneditable for the general editing community.
Editors may request edits to a template-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the `{{Edit template-protected}}` template if necessary to gain attention.
Semi-protection prevents edits from unregistered users , as well as edits from any account that is not autoconfirmed or confirmed.
This level of protection is useful when there is a significant amount of disruption or vandalism from new or unregistered users, or to prevent sockpuppets of blocked or banned users from editing, especially when it occurs on biographies of living persons who have had a recent high level of media interest.
An alternative to semi-protection is pending changes, which is sometimes favored when an article is being vandalized regularly, but otherwise receives a low amount of editing.
Such users can request edits to a semi-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the `{{Edit semi-protected}}` template if necessary to gain attention.
If the page in question and its talk page are both protected, please make your edit request at Wikipedia:Request for edit instead.
New users may also request the `confirmed` user right by visiting Requests for permissions.
Administrators may apply indefinite semi-protection to pages that are subject to heavy and persistent vandalism or violations of content policy .
Semi- protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against vandalism that has not yet occurred, nor should it be used to privilege registered users over unregistered users in content disputes.
In addition, administrators may apply temporary semi-protection on pages that are: Today's featured article may be semi-protected just like any other article.
But since that article is subject to sudden spurts of vandalism during certain times of day, administrators should semi-protect it for brief periods in most instances.
For the former guideline, see Wikipedia:Main Page featured article protection.
Administrators can prevent the creation of a page through the protection interface.
This is useful for bad articles that have been deleted but repeatedly recreated.
There are several levels of creation protection that can be applied to pages, identical to the levels for edit protection.
A list of protected titles may be found at Special:Protectedtitles .
Pre-emptive restrictions on new article titles are instituted through the title blacklist system, which allows for more flexible protection with support for substrings and regular expressions.
Pages that have been creation-protected are sometimes referred to as "salted".
Contributors wishing to re-create a salted title with appropriate content should either contact an administrator , file a request at Wikipedia:Requests for page protection, or use the deletion review process.
Some articles contain statements which have not yet been fully cited.
Some information will be considered by later contributors to be insufficiently founded and, therefore, may be removed.
While the overall trend is toward improvement, it is important to use Wikipedia carefully if it is intended to be used as a research source, since individual articles will, by their nature, vary in quality and maturity.
Guidelines and information pages are available to help users and researchers do this effectively, as is an article that summarizes third-party studies and assessments of the reliability of Wikipedia.
Wikipedia has advantages over traditional paper encyclopedias.
First, it is not limited in space: it can keep growing as fast as people add to it.
Second, there are no qualifications required to be able to author its articles.
Therefore, it has a very large pool of contributors: the whole world.
This, and the first advantage mentioned above, have enabled Wikipedia to become the most comprehensive encyclopedia on Earth.
Third, a paper encyclopedia remains static and falls out of date until the next edition.
But Wikipedia is dynamic: you don't have to wait for the next edition to come out , as Wikipedia is published on-line as it is written on-line.
Articles are made available as is, regardless of what stage of development they are in.
You can update Wikipedia at any instant, and people do so continually around the clock, thereby helping each other to keep abreast of the most recent events everywhere and of the latest facts in every subject.
Fourth, Wikipedia has a very low "publishing" cost for adding or expanding entries, as it is on-line, with no need to buy paper or ink for distribution.
This has allowed it to be made available for free, making it more accessible to everyone.
This has enabled Wikipedia to be independently developed and published in many different languages at the same time, by people literate in each language.
Of the 290+ different language Wikipedias, 137 of them have 10,000 or more articles.
Fifth, Wikipedia has a low environmental impact in some respects, since it never needs to be printed, although computers have their own environmental cost.
Instead of in-line explanations, Wikipedia incorporates hypertext in the form of wikilinks.
Throughout its content is a robust network of links, providing another dimension of knowledge accessibility.
The encyclopedia also has correlates to tables of contents and indexes, with each entry in them hyperlinked to an article on the topic specified.
Seventh, each Wikipedia article provides an introduction summarizing the more extensive detail of its contents.
Eighth, being open to anyone to edit, articles on Wikipedia are subject to additions that might be erroneous or written poorly, which in turn are subject to being corrected or rewritten.
It is a community effort, with most people who are involved helping to improve the work, fixing problems they encounter along the way.
See more about Wikipedia's strengths and weaknesses, below ...
Wikipedia's greatest strengths, weaknesses, and differences all arise because it is open to anyone, it has a large contributor base, and its articles are written by consensus, according to editorial guidelines and policies.
It is the dominant military service of the four uniformed services, controlling the most senior posts in the armed forces, and has the greatest manpower, approximately 80 percent of the combined services.
The Syrian Army originated in local military forces formed by the French after World War I, after France obtained a mandate over the region.
It officially came into being in 1945, before Syria obtained full independence the following year.
Since 1946, it has played a major role in Syria's governance, mounting six military coups: two in 1949, including the March 1949 Syrian coup d'état and the August 1949 coup by Colonel Sami al-Hinnawi, and one each in 1954, 1963, 1966, and 1970.
It has fought four wars with Israel and one with Jordan .
An armored division was also deployed to Saudi Arabia in 1990–91 during the Persian Gulf War, but saw little action.
From 1976 to 2005 it was the major pillar of the Syrian occupation of Lebanon.
Internally, it played a major part in suppressing the 1979–82 Islamist uprising in Syria, and since early 2011 has been heavily engaged in fighting the Syrian Civil War, the most violent and prolonged war the Syrian Army has taken part in since its establishment in the 1940s.
In 1919, the French formed the Troupes spéciales du Levant as part of the Army of the Levant in the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon.
The former with 8,000 men later grew into both the Syrian and Lebanese armies.
This force was used primarily as auxiliaries in support of French troops, and senior officer posts were held by Frenchmen, although Syrians were allowed to hold commissions below the rank of major.
As Syria gained independence in 1946, its leaders envisioned a division-sized army.
On June 19, 1947, the Syrian Army took the survivors of Pan Am Flight 121 to the Presbyterian mission hospital at Deir ez-Zor.
The 1st Brigade was ready by the time of the Syrian war against Israel on May 15, 1948.
It consisted of two infantry battalions and one armored battalion.
The 2nd Brigade was organized during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War and also included two infantry battalions and one armored battalion.
At the time of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the army was small, poorly armed, and poorly trained.
"Paris had relied primarily on French regulars to keep the peace in Syria and had neglected indigenous forces.
Consequently, training was lackadaisical, discipline lax, and staff work almost unheard of.
These troops were mostly grouped into three infantry brigades and an armored force of about battalion size" writes Pollack.
Between 1948 and 1967, a series of military coups destroyed the stability of the government and any remaining professionalism within the army.
In March 1949, the chief of staff, General Husni al-Za'im, installed himself as president.
Two more military dictators followed by December 1949.
General Adib Shishakli then held power until deposed in the 1954 Syrian coup d'etat.
Further coups followed, each attended by a purge of the officer corps to remove supporters of the losers from the force.
'Discipline in the army broke down across the board as units and their commanders pledged their allegiance to different groups and parties.
Indeed, by the late 1950s, the situation had become so bad that Syrian officers regularly disobeyed the orders of superiors who belonged to different ethnic or political groups' writes Pollack.
The 1963 Syrian coup d'état had as one of its key objectives the seizure of the Al-Kiswah military camp, home to the 70th Armored Brigade.
However, in 1967 the army did appear to have some strength.
It had around 70,000 personnel, roughly 550 tanks and assault guns, 500 APCs, and nearly 300 artillery pieces.
The army had sixteen brigades: twelve infantry, two armored , and two mechanized.
The Syrian government deployed twelve of the sixteen brigades to the Golan, including both armored brigades and one mechanized brigade.
, a 1997 educational film co-produced by the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, before making appearances in minor television roles in the early 2000s.
Evans has described his filmography of the early to mid 2000s as being "really terrible." He appeared in the television comedy- drama Opposite Sex , comedies Not Another Teen Movie and The Perfect Score , and the action thriller Cellular .
In 2005, Evans had his breakthrough performance as Johnny Storm / Human Torch in the superhero film Fantastic Four , his highest-paid role at the time, and reprised the role for the film's 2007 sequel Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer.
Fantastic Four would be the first of many roles in films adapted from comic books and graphic novels for Evans, including Casey Jones in TMNT , Jake Jensen in The Losers , Lucas Lee in Scott Pilgrim vs.
His most prolific comic book movie role would be as Steve Rogers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe series of films, with credited appearances and cameos as the character in eleven films and one video game; notable appearances include the headlining films Captain America: The First Avenger , Captain America: The Winter Soldier , and Captain America: Civil War , and the ensemble films The Avengers , Avengers: Age of Ultron , Avengers: Infinity War , and Avengers: Endgame .
While comic book films formed the bulk of Evans' filmography from the late 2000s through the entirety of the 2010s, he concurrently acted in a range of non-comic book projects including Danny Boyle's psychological thriller Sunshine , the film adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond , and Marc Webb's drama Gifted .
He also starred in several romantic comedy films, including The Nanny Diaries , What's Your Number?
, and Playing It Cool , the latter of which he also executive produced.
Evans made his directorial debut in 2014 with the romantic drama Before We Go , which he also produced and starred in.
His Broadway debut was in the 2018 revival of Kenneth Lonergan's play Lobby Hero , for which he was nominated for a Drama League Award.
He received critical acclaim for playing a rebellious scion in Rian Johnson's Knives Out .
The Prime Minister directs both the executive and the legislature, and together with their Cabinet is accountable to the Monarch, to Parliament, to their party, and ultimately to the electorate, for the government's policies and actions.
The Office of the Prime Minister is not established by any statute or constitutional document but exists only by long-established convention, whereby the reigning Monarch appoints as Prime Minister the person most likely to command the confidence of the House of Commons; this individual is typically the leader of the political party or coalition of parties that holds the largest number of seats in that chamber.
The position of Prime Minister was not created; it evolved slowly and organically over three hundred years due to numerous Acts of Parliament, political developments, and accidents of history.
The office is therefore best understood from a historical perspective.
The origins of the position are found in constitutional changes that occurred during the Revolutionary Settlement and the resulting shift of political power from the Sovereign to Parliament.
Although the sovereign was not stripped of the ancient prerogative powers and legally remained the head of government, politically it gradually became necessary for him or her to govern through a Prime Minister who could command a majority in Parliament.
By the 1830s, the Westminster system of government had emerged; the Prime Minister had become primus inter pares or the first among equals in the Cabinet and the head of government in the United Kingdom.
The political position of Prime Minister was enhanced by the development of modern political parties, the introduction of mass communication and photography.
By the start of the 20th century the modern premiership had emerged; the office had become the pre-eminent position in the constitutional hierarchy vis-à-vis the Sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet.
Prior to 1902, the Prime Minister sometimes came from the House of Lords, provided that his government could form a majority in the Commons.
However as the power of the aristocracy waned during the 19th century the convention developed that the prime minister should always sit as a Member of Parliament in the lower house, making them answerable only to the Commons in Parliament.
As leader of the House of Commons, the Prime Minister's authority was further enhanced by the Parliament Act 1911 which marginalised the influence of the House of Lords in the law-making process.
The Prime Minister is ex officio also First Lord of the Treasury, Minister for the Civil Service and Minister for the Union.
Indeed, certain privileges, such as residency of 10 Downing Street, are accorded to Prime Ministers by virtue of their position as First Lord of the Treasury.
The status and executive powers of the British Prime Minister means that the incumbent is consistently ranked as one of the most powerful and influential people in the world.
The Prime Minister is the head of the United Kingdom government.
As such, the modern Prime Minister leads the Cabinet .
In addition, the prime minister leads a major political party and generally commands a majority in the House of Commons .
The incumbent wields both significant legislative and executive powers.
Under the British system, there is a unity of powers rather than separation.
In the House of Commons, the prime minister guides the law-making process with the goal of enacting the legislative agenda of their political party.
In an executive capacity, the prime minister appoints all other Cabinet members and ministers, and co-ordinates the policies and activities of all government departments, and the staff of the Civil Service.
The prime minister also acts as the public "face" and "voice" of Her Majesty's Government, both at home and abroad.
Solely upon the advice of the prime minister, the Sovereign exercises many statutory and prerogative powers, including high judicial, political, official and Church of England ecclesiastical appointments; the conferral of peerages and some knighthoods, decorations and other important honours.
The British system of government is based on an uncodified constitution, meaning that it is not set out in any single document.
The British constitution consists of many documents and most importantly for the evolution of the office of the prime minister, it is based on customs known as constitutional conventions that became accepted practice.
Asquith described this characteristic of the British constitution in his memoirs: The relationships between the prime minister and the sovereign, Parliament and Cabinet are defined largely by these unwritten conventions of the constitution.
Many of the prime minister's executive and legislative powers are actually royal prerogatives which are still formally vested in the sovereign, who remains the head of state.
Despite its growing dominance in the constitutional hierarchy, the premiership was given little formal recognition until the 20th century; the legal fiction was maintained that the Sovereign still governed directly.
The position was first mentioned in statute only in 1917, in the schedule of the Chequers Estate Act.
Increasingly during the 20th century, the office and role of prime minister featured in statute law and official documents; however, the Prime Minister's powers and relationships with other institutions still largely continue to derive from ancient royal prerogatives and historic and modern constitutional conventions.
Prime ministers continue to hold the position of First Lord of the Treasury and, since November 1968, that of Minister for the Civil Service, the latter giving them authority over the civil service.
Under this arrangement, Britain might appear to have two executives: the prime minister and the sovereign.
The Crown symbolises the state's authority to govern: to make laws and execute them, impose taxes and collect them, declare war and make peace.
Austria played its first international match on 12 October 1902, defeating neighbouring Hungary 5–0 in a friendly.
The team is governed by the Austrian Football Association and competes as a member of the Union of European Football Associations , which encompasses the countries of Europe and Israel.
As of November 2019, Austria has played a total of 783 international matches, winning 325, drawing 169 and losing 289.
Austria have played Hungary most frequently, meeting the side 137 times.
Of these, Austria have won 40, drawn 30 and lost 67.
The Austria–Hungary football rivalry is the second-most played international fixture in football history, behind only the Argentina–Uruguay rivalry which has been played officially 193 times.
Andi Herzog is Austria's most capped player with 103 caps.
He made his international debut on 6 April 1988 in a 2–2 draw with Greece and equalled Toni Polster's caps record on 17 April 2002 by winning his 95th cap.
He surpassed Polster one month later in his next appearance and went on to finish his career with 103 caps, having become the only Austrian to win more than 100 caps.
Polster remains Austria's highest goalscorer with 44 goals, including three hat-tricks and six braces.
Jan Studnicka, who scored a hat-trick in Austria's first international fixture, was the first player to amass 25 caps for the side.
He achieved the tally in November 1917 but attained only three more caps for the national side during his career.
Alexander Popovic set a new caps record in April 1921 by winning his 29th cap before Josef Brandstätter claimed the record a year later.
Josef Blum equalled Brandstätter's record in 1929 but did not surpass him for nearly two years before becoming the new record holder when he won his next cap.
He finished his career with 51 caps, becoming the first player to reach 50 appearances for the national side.
Ernst Ocwirk held the caps record between 1954 and 1957 before Gerhard Hanappi became the record holder after his 62nd appearance.
Hanappi's first 55 caps had been won in a consecutive spell of fixtures between November 1948 and May 1956.
His final tally of 93 appearances stood for more than 40 years until Polster overtook the record during the group stage of the 1998 FIFA World Cup.
Having equalled Hanappi's record in Austria's second group game against Chile, he won his 94th cap in his side's final group match with Italy.
Polster appeared only once more for Austria after the tournament, retiring with 95 caps.
These initial characters are displayed above the sections.
To suppress these, make all sort keys start with a space.
A category page can only display a limited number of items .
If more pages belong to the category, there will be a link to the next ones.
The categories box for the category page appears at the bottom, in the same place as for other pages.
This contains the categories to which the current category page has been added, i.e.
Add a category page to other categories in the normal way, using the "[[Category: Category name ]]" or "[[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]]" syntax.
A page belongs to a category if the page's wikimarkup contains a declaration for that category.
A category declaration takes the form `[[Category: Category name ]]` or `[[Category: Category name | Sortkey ]]`.
it will not work if it appears between `<nowiki>...</nowiki>` or `<includeonly>...</includeonly>` tags, or in a comment.
The declaration may however come from a transcluded page; see Categories and templates below.
A category name can be any string that would be a legitimate page title.
If the category name begins with a lower-case letter it will be capitalized.
In Wikipedia, it is customary to place category declarations at the end of the wikimarkup, but before any stub templates and interlanguage links.
When a page has been added to one or more categories, a categories box appears at the bottom of the page .
This box contains a list of the categories the page belongs to, in the order in which the category declarations appear in the processed wikimarkup.
The category names are linked to the corresponding category pages.
They appear as redlinks if the corresponding category page does not exist.
If a user has enabled the HotCat gadget, the categories box will also provide links to quickly add, remove, or modify category declarations on the page, without having to edit the whole page.
Hidden categories are not displayed, except as described below under Hiding categories.
The following subsections are ordered from simple actions to more elaborate or rarer actions.
To link to a category page without putting the current page in that category, precede the link with a colon: [[:Category: Category name ]].
Raw information about the members of a category, their sortkeys and timestamps can be obtained from the API, using a query of the form: Listings of up to 500 members are possible.
If there are more members then the results will include text near the end like this: `<categorymembers cmcontinue="page|NNNN|TITLE" />`.
This can be added to the previous one, without quotation marks, for the next page of members: `...&cmcontinue=page|NNNN|TITLE` By default, a page is sorted under the first character of its name, without the namespace.
English Wikipedia groups accented characters together with their unaccented version, so pages starting with À, Á, Ä, will be listed under heading A.
Sorting is case-insensitive, so "ABC" comes after "Abacus".
Unlike at Special:Allpages and Special:Prefixindex, a space is treated as a space , not as an underscore.
The English Wikipedia has numerical sorting in categories.
This means a page whose title begins with a number will be sorted according to the numeric value of the number .
Thus "9 dogs", "25 dogs", and "112 dogs" will all appear under the "0–9" heading in numeric order.
If the number includes a comma, space, or period, the sorting algorithm will only consider the part of the number before the separator.

From 2015, Barnier served as unpaid special adviser on European defence policy to President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker.
On 27 July 2016, he was announced as the European Commission's chief negotiator with the United Kingdom over leaving the European Union, under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union.
Commenting on the appointment, Juncker said: "I wanted an experienced politician for this difficult job." In January 2019, following the Brady Amendment vote in the UK House of Commons, Michel Barnier said the Irish backstop is "part and parcel" of the UK's Brexit withdrawal agreement and will not be renegotiated.

In the table under Lists of featured content, the number of former featured articles has a thousands comma and the numbers in the top row don't.
I tried to find where these numbers are being formatted but couldn't figure out how the series of transclusions works.
— Nizolan 20:35, 3 July 2019 Since this page is the third link in the main sidebar, and gets 5,000 daily pageviews , can we trim it of some of the weird links?
The table at the beginning is confusing and unappealing even to an editor like me—entries like "3493 / T" or "FLRC / T" aren't going to be parseable to the average reader of Wikipedia.
I'd say we don't really want an interested reader who's never edited to be directly clicking on a link to Wikipedia talk:Featured topics anyway—the description at Wikipedia:Featured topics would be a better overview and from there they could investigate some of the internal links further if they were keen.
And the main FA, FL, FT, FP links are already present at the top of the lists of recently promoted content.
Then there's also the odd collection of links under the header "Featured content procedures"; I can't imagine that the first two are even useful to any editors and none of the links are great for a casual reader.
And lastly, the "Shortcuts" box is too cluttered and distracting to a reader who just clicked on a sidebar link—I'd trim it to just "P:FC".
I'm posting here rather than just editing because I'd like to hear other people's thoughts, but if there's no response I'll likely take that as consensus and implement these suggestions in a week.
To make a convincing case for re-creation, it is helpful to show a draft version of the intended article when filing a request.
Administrators should choose the appropriate level of create protection—autoconfirmed, extended-confirmed, or full.
Due to the implementation of ACPERM, non-confirmed editors cannot create pages in mainspace; thus, semi-creation protection should be rare, used only for protection of pages outside of mainspace.
While creation-protection is usually permanent, temporary creation protection may be applied if a page is repeatedly recreated by a single user .
Move protected pages, or more technically, fully move-protected pages, cannot be moved to a new title except by an administrator.
Move protection is commonly applied to: Fully edit-protected pages are also implicitly move-protected.
As with full edit protection, protection because of edit warring should not be considered an endorsement of the current name.
When move protection is applied during a requested move discussion, the page should be protected at the location it was at when the move request was started.
All files are implicitly move-protected; only file movers and administrators can move files.
Upload protected files, or more technically, fully upload-protected files, cannot be replaced with new versions except by an administrator.
Upload protection does not protect file pages from editing.
Upload protection may be applied by an administrator to: As with full edit protection, administrators should avoid favoring one file version over another, and protection should not be considered an endorsement of the current file version.
An obvious exception to this rule is when files are protected due to upload vandalism.
Pending changes protection is a tool used to suppress vandalism and certain other persistent problems while allowing all users to continue to submit edits.
Pending changes protection can be used as an alternative to semi- protection to allow unregistered and new users to edit pages, while keeping the edits hidden from the view of most readers until those changes are accepted by a reviewer.
When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an unregistered editor or a new user, the edit is not directly visible to the majority of Wikipedia readers, until it is reviewed and accepted by an editor with the pending changes reviewer right.
When a page under pending changes protection is edited by an autoconfirmed user, the edit will be immediately visible to Wikipedia readers.
Pending changes are visible in the page history, where they are marked as pending review.
Readers not logged in are shown the latest accepted version of the page; logged-in users see the latest version of the page, with all changes applied.
When editors who are not reviewers make changes to an article with unreviewed pending changes, their edits are also marked as pending and are not visible to most readers.
A user who clicks "edit this page" is always, at that point, shown the latest version of the page for editing regardless of whether the user is logged in or not.
Reviewing of pending changes should be resolved within reasonable time limits.
Pending changes may be used to protect articles against: Pending changes protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against violations that have not yet occurred.
Like semi-protection, PC protection should never be used in genuine content disputes, where there is a risk of placing a particular group of editors at a disadvantage.
Pending changes protection should not be used on articles with a very high edit rate, even if they meet the aforementioned criteria.
In addition, administrators may apply temporary pending changes protection on pages that are subject to significant but temporary vandalism or disruption when blocking individual users is not a feasible option.
As with other forms of protection, the time frame of the protection should be proportional to the problem.
Indefinite PC protection should be used only in cases of severe long-term disruption.
Removal of pending changes protection can be requested of any administrator, or at requests for unprotection.
The reviewing process is described in detail at Wikipedia:Reviewing pending changes.
Extended confirmed protection, also known as 30/500 protection, allows edits only by editors with the extended confirmed user access level, granted automatically to registered users with at least 30 days tenure and 500 edits.
Where semi-protection has proven to be ineffective, administrators may use extended confirmed protection to combat disruption on any topic.
The MediaWiki software that runs Wikipedia retains a history of all edits and changes, thus information added to Wikipedia never "vanishes" irreversibly.
Discussion pages are an important resource on contentious topics.
Therefore, serious researchers can often find a wide range of vigorously or thoughtfully advocated viewpoints not present in the consensus article.
A 2005 editorial by a BBC technology writer comments that these debates are probably symptomatic of cultural changes that are happening across all sources of information , and may lead to "a better sense of how to evaluate information sources".
Wikipedia disclaimers apply to all pages on Wikipedia.
However, the consensus in Wikipedia is to put all disclaimers only as links and at the end of each article.
Proposals to have a warning box at the beginning have been rejected.
Some do not like the way it looks or that it calls attention to possible errors in Wikipedia.
Wikipedia, in common with many websites, has a disclaimer that, at times, has led to commentators citing these in order to support a view that Wikipedia is unreliable.
A selection of similar disclaimers from places which are often regarded as reliable can be read and compared at Wikipedia:Non-Wikipedia disclaimers.
Anyone can contribute to Wikipedia by clicking on the Edit tab in an article.
Before beginning to contribute, however, read some handy helping tools such as the tutorial and the policies and guidelines, as well as our welcome page.
It is important to realize that in contributing to Wikipedia, users are expected to be civil and neutral, respecting all points of view, and add only verifiable and factual information rather than personal views and opinions.
"The five pillars of Wikipedia" cover this approach and are recommended reading before editing.
Most articles start as stubs, but after many contributions, they can become featured articles.
Once the contributor has decided a topic of interest, they may want to request that the article be written .
Wikipedia has on-going projects, focused on specific topic areas or tasks, which help coordinate editing.
The ease of editing Wikipedia results in many people editing.
That makes the updating of the encyclopedia very quick, almost as fast as news websites.
Wikipedia uses a simple yet powerful page layout to allow editors to concentrate on adding material rather than page design.
Page aspects facilitated include: Normally editing is chosen by clicking the `Edit` tab at the top of a Wikipedia page .
This will take you to a new page with a text box containing the editable text of the page you were viewing.
In this box, you can type in the text that you want to add, using wiki markup to format the text and add other elements like images and tables.
You should then press the `Show preview` button to review your contributions for any errors.
When you have finished editing, you should write a short edit summary in the small field below the edit-box describing your changes before you press the `Publish changes` button.
This will help others to understand the intention of your edit.
To avoid accidentally leaving edit summaries blank, you can select "Prompt me when entering a blank edit summary" on the `Edit` tab of your personal preferences.
Page editing is accessed through tabs that are found along the top edge of the page.
These are: Wikipedia has robust version and reversion controls.
This means that poor- quality edits or vandalism can quickly and easily be reversed or brought up to an appropriate standard by any other editor, so inexperienced editors cannot accidentally do permanent harm if they make a mistake in their editing.
As there are many more editors intent on improving articles than not, error- ridden articles are usually corrected promptly.
Wikipedia content is intended to be factual, notable, verifiable with cited external sources, and neutrally presented.
The appropriate policies and guidelines for these are found at: These are often abbreviated to WP:NOT, WP:NPOV, WP:NOR, WP:V, WP:RS, WP:CITE, and WP:MOS respectively.
The Wikipedia community is largely self-organising, so that anyone may build a reputation as a competent editor and become involved in any role s/he may choose, subject to peer approval.
Individuals often will choose to become involved in specialised tasks, such as reviewing articles at others' request, watching current edits for vandalism, watching newly created articles for quality control purposes, or similar roles.
This category and its subcategories contain project pages which have been semi-protected in line with the Wikipedia:Protection policy.
Semi- protection prevents a page from being edited by anonymous and newly registered users.
For fully protected pages, which can be edited only by administrators, see Category:Wikipedia protected pages.
To add a page to this category, use {{pp-semi-protected}}.
This should only be done if the page is in fact semi-protected.
Note that adding the template does not in itself protect the page.
Conversely, protecting the page does not automatically add the template , which results in some pages having a "view source"-tab instead of "edit this page" and yet not showing "Semi-protected" at the bottom -- a situation new users may find rather confusing.
Therefore, it is best to always add the template immediately after protecting the page.

Three 'brigade groups', each comprising four brigades, were deployed: the 12th in the north, holding the sector from the B'nat Ya'acov bridge to the slopes of Mount Hermon, the 35th in the south from the B'nat Ya'acov bridge to the Yarmuk River border with Jordan, and the 42nd in reserve, earmarked for a theater-level counterattack role.
During the Six-Day War Israeli assault of the Golan heights, the Syrian army failed to counterattack the Israelis as the Israelis breached the Syrian positions.
While Syrian units fought hard whenever the Israelis entered their fields of fire, no attempts appear to have been made to exploit Israeli disorientation and confusion during the initial assault.
Judging from reports of 1967–1970, including the reporting of the 5th Infantry Division in 1970, the Army appears to have formed its first divisions during this period.
The 1st and 3rd Armored Division, and 5th, 7th, and 9th Mechanized Infantry Divisions were all formed prior to 1973.
Katz writes that after Hafez al-Assad gained power in November 1970, the army expanded to the five divisions listed above, plus ten independent brigades, an artillery rocket brigade , and "a reinforced brigade variously termed the 70th Armored Brigade or the Assad Republican Guard.
It is today known as the Armored Defense Force; as Assad's praetorian guard it is stationed in and around Damascus and subordinate to the Defense Companies under the command of Assad's brother Rifa'at." On 18 September 1970, the Syrian government became involved in Black September in Jordan when it sent a reinforced armored brigade to aid the Palestine Liberation Organization.
Syrian armored units crossed the border and overran Irbid with the help of local Palestinian forces.
They encountered several Jordanian Army detachments, but rebuffed them without major difficulty.
Two days later, the 5th Infantry Division, heavily reinforced, was also sent into Jordan.
Two armored brigades were attached to the division, bringing its tank strength up to over 300 T-55s and its manpower to over 16,000.
The division entered Jordan at ar-Ramtha, destroyed a company of Jordanian Centurion tanks there, and continued directly towards Amman.
Pollack says it is likely that they intended to overthrow the Jordanian monarchy itself.
Despite defeating the Jordanian Army at al-Ramtha on 21 September, after fierce air attacks on 22 September, the Syrians stopped the attack and began to retreat.
After 1970 further Syrian engagements included: The Syrian armed forces have also been involved in suppressing dissident movements within Syria, for example the Islamist uprising in Syria in 1979–1982.
In March 1980 the 3rd Armored Division and detachments from the Defense Companies arrived in Aleppo.
The division was under the command of General Shafiq Fayadh, Hafiz Assad's first cousin.
The troops sealed "off whole quarters and carr[ied] out house-to-house searches, often preceded by tank fire." Hundreds of suspects were rounded up.
Only two conventional Army brigades deployed to Hama in 1982, the 3rd Armored Division's 47th Armored and 21st Mechanized Brigades.
Three quarters of the officers and one third of the soldiers in the two brigades were Alawites.
Most of the repression was carried out by the Defense Companies and the Special Forces.
Meanwhile, the Special Forces were isolating and combing through Hama, killing and capturing suspected government opponents.
Syrian forces fought Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War.
In 1984, Major General Ali Haidar's Special Forces were instrumental in blocking an abortive attempt by Rifaat Assad and his Defense Companies to seize the capital.
Fayadh's 3rd Armored Division moved into the capital to join Haidar's forces in the confrontation with the Defense Companies.
The 3rd Armored Division, it seems, had historically been based at al-Qutayfah, near Damascus.
Bennett dates the establishment of corps in the Syrian Army to 1985.
Writing forty years later, Tom Cooper says they were established 'during the 1980s' but "..despite the establishment of..
most division commanders continued reporting directly to the President.
Correspondingly, not only the Chief of Staff of the Syrian Armed Forces but also the Corps HQ exercised only a limited operational control over the Army's divisions." The 9th Armored Division served in the 1991 Persian Gulf War as the Arab Joint Forces Command North reserve and saw little action.
In 1994, Haidar expressed objections to the Syrian president's decision to bring Bashar home from his studies in Britain and groom him for the succession after the death of Basil, the eldest Assad son.
Soon afterwards, on 3 September 1994, Jane's Defence Weekly reported that then-President Hafez Assad had dismissed at least 16 senior military commanders.
Among them was Haidar, then commander of the Special Forces, and General Shafiq Fayadh, a cousin of the President who had commanded the "crack" 3rd Armored Division for nearly two decades.
Before the "Glorious Revolution" of 1688, the sovereign exclusively wielded the powers of the Crown; afterwards, Parliament gradually forced monarchs to assume a neutral political position.
Parliament has effectively dispersed the powers of the Crown, entrusting its authority to responsible ministers , accountable for their policies and actions to Parliament, in particular the elected House of Commons.
Although many of the sovereign's prerogative powers are still legally intact,[note 1] constitutional conventions have removed the monarch from day- to-day governance, with ministers exercising the royal prerogatives, leaving the monarch in practice with three constitutional rights: to be kept informed, to advise, and to warn.
Because the premiership was not intentionally created, there is no exact date when its evolution began.
A meaningful starting point, however, is 1688–89 when James II fled England and the Parliament of England confirmed William III and Mary II as joint constitutional monarchs, enacting legislation that limited their authority and that of their successors: the Bill of Rights , the Mutiny Bill , the Triennial Bill , the Treason Act and the Act of Settlement .
Known collectively as the Revolutionary Settlement, these acts transformed the constitution, shifting the balance of power from the Sovereign to Parliament.
They also provided the basis for the evolution of the office of prime minister, which did not exist at that time.
The Revolutionary Settlement gave the Commons control over finances and legislation and changed the relationship between the Executive and the Legislature.
For want of money, sovereigns had to summon Parliament annually and could no longer dissolve or prorogue it without its advice and consent.
Parliament became a permanent feature of political life.
The veto fell into disuse because sovereigns feared that if they denied legislation, Parliament would deny them money.
No sovereign has denied royal assent since Queen Anne vetoed the Scottish Militia Bill in 1708.
Treasury officials and other department heads were drawn into Parliament serving as liaisons between it and the sovereign.
Ministers had to present the government's policies, and negotiate with Members to gain the support of the majority; they had to explain the government's financial needs, suggest ways of meeting them and give an account of how money had been spent.
The Sovereign's representatives attended Commons sessions so regularly that they were given reserved seats at the front, known as the Treasury Bench.
This is the beginning of "unity of powers": the sovereign's ministers became leading members of Parliament .
Today the prime minister , the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other senior members of the Cabinet sit on the Treasury bench and present policies in much the same way Ministers did late in the 17th century.
After the Revolution, there was a constant threat that non-government members of Parliament would ruin the country's finances by proposing ill-considered money bills.
Vying for control to avoid chaos, the Crown's Ministers gained an advantage in 1706, when the Commons informally declared, "That this House will receive no petition for any sum of money relating to public Service, but what is recommended from the Crown." On 11 June 1713, this non-binding rule became Standing Order 66: that "the Commons would not vote money for any purpose, except on a motion of a Minister of the Crown." Standing Order 66 remains in effect today , essentially unchanged for three hundred years.
Studnicka also held the goalscoring record for the national side from the team's first match until 1929, although Ferdinand Swatosch did equal his tally of 18 in 1925.
Johann Horvath overtook the pair with a brace against Italy.
Horvath and Anton Schall competed for the record for several years as part of Austria's "Wunderteam"; Schall surpassed Horvath in 1933 before Horvath reclaimed the record the following year.
Schall tied the new record a week later with his final international goal, but Horvath went on to score two more goals before retiring to finish his career with 29 goals.
Horvath's record stood for 46 years until Hans Krankl scored his 30th international goal in November 1980, going on to finish his career with 34 goals.
Krankl's total included six goals during a 9–0 victory over Malta in 1977, the most goals scored in a single international match by an Austrian player.
The current record holder, Toni Polster, surpassed Krankl in 1996 and eventually ended his career with 44 international goals.
Appearances and goals are composed ofFIFA World Cup and UEFA European Championships, and each competition's required qualification matches, as well as numerous international friendly tournaments and matches.
If the number of caps is equal, the players are then listed alphabetically.
Statistics updated following match played on 19 November 2019.
Each of the three lists is arranged in the order explained above .
If an item ought to be positioned within a list on the basis of an alternative name for that item, then this can be specified in the category tag that places the item in the list: For example, to add an article called Albert Einstein to the category "People" and have the article sorted by "Einstein, Albert", you would type: Unlike a piped link , the sort key itself is not displayed to readers.
It affects only the order in which pages are listed on the category page.
It is useful to document the system being used for sort keys on the category page.
For guidelines about the use of sort keys on Wikipedia, see WP:SORTKEY.
It is possible to set a default sort key which is different from PAGENAME by using the magic word DEFAULTSORT: In the case of multiple default sort key tags, the last DEFAULTSORT on the final rendering of a page applies for all categories, regardless of the position of the category tags.
This also means that a DEFAULTSORT tag included from a template is not effective if another DEFAULTSORT tag occurs later on the page, even if the later DEFAULTSORT tag is also "hidden" .
In addition to browsing through hierarchies of categories, it is possible to use the search tool to find specific articles in specific categories.
To search for articles in a specific category, type incategory:" CategoryName " in the search box.
An "OR" can be added to join the contents of one category with the contents of another.
For example, enter to return all pages that belong to either of the categories, as here.
Note that using search to find categories will not find articles which have been categorized using templates.
This feature also doesn't return pages in subcategories.
Special:Categories provides an alphabetic list of all categories, with the number of members of each; this number does not include the content of the subcategories, but it includes the subcategories themselves, i.e., each counting as one.
The above list contains all categories that have members, regardless of whether they have corresponding category pages.
To list all existing category pages , use Special:AllPages/Category:.
As described at mw:Help:Magic words,  Example  or  Example  returns the number of pages in "Category:Example".
Each subcategory counts as one page; pages in subcategories are not counted.
The page Special:CategoryTree enables you to see the tree structure of a category .
The CategoryTree extension can be used to display such a tree on any page.
The basic syntax is to display just the subcategory tree, and to display member pages as well.
Dapete's category-visualizer vCat will render charts of the tree structure.
You may also use Template:Category tree or Template:Category tree all, instead.
Warning: Categories can be moved in the same way as an ordinary page; but a certain amount of cleanup may be necessary.
The Kingdom of Norway accepted the convention on 12 May 1977, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list.
As of 2017, there are eight World Heritage Sites in Norway, including seven cultural sites and one natural site.
There is one transnational site, the Struve Geodetic Arc, that is shared with nine other countries.
Norway's first two sites, Urnes Stave Church and Bryggen, were inscribed on the list at the 3rd session of the World Heritage Committee, held in Cairo and Luxor, Egypt in 1979.
The latest inscription, the Rjukan–Notodden Industrial Heritage Site, was added to the list in 2015.
In addition to its World Heritage Sites, Norway also maintains five properties on its tentative list, three of which are transnational nominations.
UNESCO lists sites under ten criteria; each entry must meet at least one of the criteria.
Criteria i through vi are cultural, whereas vii through x are natural.
In addition to sites inscribed on the World Heritage List, member states can maintain a list of tentative sites that they may consider for nomination.
Nominations for the World Heritage List are only accepted if the site was previously listed on the tentative list.
As of 2019, Norway lists five properties on its tentative list.
He previously served as Prime Minister of Turkey from 2003 to 2014 and as Mayor of Istanbul from 1994 to 1998.
He founded the Justice and Development Party in 2001, leading it to election victories in 2002, 2007 and 2011 before standing down upon his election as President in 2014.
Coming from an Islamist political background and as a self-described conservative democrat, he has promoted socially conservative and liberal economic policies in his administration.
Erdoğan played football for Kasımpaşa before being elected as the Mayor of Istanbul in 1994, as the candidate of the Islamist Welfare Party.
He was later stripped of his position, banned from political office, and imprisoned for four months for inciting religious hatred.
Erdoğan subsequently abandoned openly Islamist politics, establishing the moderate conservative AKP in 2001, which he went on to lead to a landslide victory in 2002.
With Erdoğan still technically prohibited from holding office, the AKP's co-founder, Abdullah Gül, instead became Prime Minister, and later annulled Erdoğan's political ban.
After winning a by-election in Siirt in 2003, Erdoğan replaced Gül as Prime Minister, with Gül instead becoming the AKP's candidate for the presidency.
Erdoğan led the AKP to two more election victories in 2007 and 2011, before being elected President in 2014, and re-elected in 2018.
The early years of Erdoğan's tenure as prime minister saw advances in negotiations for Turkey's membership of the European Union, an economic recovery following a financial crash in 2001 and investments in infrastructure including roads, airports, and a high-speed train network.
He also won two successful constitutional referendums in 2007 and 2010.
However, his government remained controversial for its close links with Fethullah Gülen and his Gülen Movement, now designated as a terrorist organisation, with whom the AKP was accused of orchestrating purges against secular bureaucrats and military officers through the Balyoz and Ergenekon trials.
In late 2012, his government began peace negotiations with the Kurdistan Workers Party to end the ongoing PKK insurgency that began in 1978.
The ceasefire broke down in 2015, leading to a renewed escalation in conflict.
Erdoğan's foreign policy has been described as Neo-Ottoman and has involved attempts to prevent Syrian-Kurdish PYD/YPG forces from gaining ground on the Turkish–Syrian border during the Syrian Civil War.
Erdoğan's government has been accused of democratic backsliding and corruption in later years.
Starting with the anti-government protests in 2013, his government imposed growing censorship on the press and social media, imposing blocks on sites such as YouTube, Twitter and Wikipedia.
This stalled negotiations related to EU membership.
A US$100 billion corruption scandal in 2013 led to the arrests of Erdoğan's close allies, and incriminated Erdoğan.
Following a souring in relations with Gülen, Erdoğan proceeded to purge his supporters from judicial, bureaucratic and military positions.
A failed military coup d'état attempt in July 2016 resulted in further purges and a state of emergency.
The government claimed that the coup leaders were linked to Gülen, but he has denied any role in it.
As a long-standing proponent of changing Turkey's parliamentary system of government into an executive presidency, Erdoğan formed an alliance with the far-right Nationalist Movement Party to establish an executive presidency in 2017, where the changes were accepted in a constitutional referendum.
Extended confirmed protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against disruption that has not yet occurred, nor should it be used to privilege extended confirmed users over unregistered users in valid content disputes on articles not covered by Arbitration Committee 30/500 rulings.
Extended confirmed protection may be applied by an administrator at their discretion when creation-protecting a page.
Until August 12, 2016, 30/500 protection applied only in topic areas determined by the Arbitration Committee, which authorized its use on articles reasonably construed as belonging to the Arab–Israeli conflict; as an arbitration enforcement tool by motion or remedy; or as a result of community consensus.
In February 2019, the community authorized uninvolved administrators to place pages reasonably construed as belonging to the India–Pakistan conflict under extended confirmed protection as part of a general sanctions regime.
As of September 23, 2016, a bot posts a notification in a subsection of AN when this protection level is used.
A full list of the 1929 pages under 30/500 protection can be found here.
Users can request edits to an extended confirmed-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the `{{Edit extended-protected}}` template if necessary to gain attention.
As outlined in Meta:Office actions#Use of advanced rights by Foundation staff, pages may be protected by Wikimedia Foundation staff in response to issues such as copyright infringement or libel.
Administrators should not edit or unprotect such pages without permission from Wikimedia Foundation staff.
Cascading protection fully protects a page, and extends that full protection automatically to any page that is transcluded onto the protected page, whether directly or indirectly.
This includes templates, images and other media that are hosted on the English Wikipedia.
Files stored on Commons are not protected by any other wiki's cascading protection and must be temporarily uploaded to the English Wikipedia or protected at Commons, either manually or through cascading protection there.
When operational, KrinkleBot cascade-protects Commons files transcluded at Wikipedia:Main Page/Tomorrow, Wikipedia:Main Page/Commons media protection and Main Page.
As the bot's response time varies, media should not be transcluded on the main page until after it has been protected.
Cascading protection: The list of cascading-protected pages can be found at Wikipedia:Cascade- protected items.
Requests to add or remove cascading protection on a page should be made at Wikipedia talk:Cascade-protected items as an edit request.
Superprotect was a level of protection, allowing editing only by Wikimedia Foundation employees who are in the Staff global group.
It was implemented on August 10, 2014 and used the same day to override community consensus regarding the use of the Media Viewer on the German Wikipedia's primary site JavaScript, common.js.
On November 5, 2015, the WMF decided to remove superprotect from all Wikimedia wikis.
Cascading semi-protection was formerly possible, but it was disabled in 2007 after users noticed that non-administrators could fully protect any page by transcluding it onto the page to which cascading semi-protection had been applied by an administrator.
Originally, two levels of pending changes protection existed, where level 2 required edits by all users who are not pending changes reviewers to be reviewed.
Following a community discussion, level 2 was retired from the English Wikipedia in January 2017.
It was suggested then that "Pending changes level 1" be referred to in the future as simply "Pending changes".
Modifications to a protected page can be proposed on its talk page for discussion.
Administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting consensus.
Placing the Edit protected template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.
Talk pages are not usually protected, and are semi-protected only for a limited duration in the most severe cases of vandalism.
User talk pages are rarely protected, and are semi-protected for short durations only in the most severe cases of vandalism from IP users.
Users whose talk pages are semi-protected should have an unprotected user talk subpage linked conspicuously from their main talk page to allow good-faith comments from non-autoconfirmed users.
A user's request to have his or her own talk page protected is not a sufficient rationale by itself to protect the page, although requests may be considered if a reason is provided.
Blocked users' user talk pages should not ordinarily be protected, as this interferes with the user's ability to contest their block through the normal process.
It also prevents others from being able to use the talk page to communicate with the blocked editor.
In extreme cases of abuse by the blocked user, such as abuse of the unblocktemplate, re-blocking the user without talk page access should be preferred over protection.
If the user has been indefinitely blocked from editing the talk page, they should be informed of off-wiki ways to appeal their block, such as the UTRS tool interface or as a last recourse, the Arbitration Committee.
Editors who believe they can serve the community better by taking on additional administrative responsibility may ask their peers for agreement to undertake such responsibilities.
This structure enforces meritocracy and communal standards of editorship and conduct.
At present a minimum approval of 75–80% from the community is required to take on these additional tools and responsibilities.
This standard tends to ensure a high level of experience, trust, and familiarity across a broad front of aspects within Wikipedia.
A variety of software-assisted systems and automated programs help editors and administrators to watch for problematic edits and editors.
Theoretically all editors and users are treated equally with no "power structure".
There is, however, a hierarchy of permissions and positions, some of which are listed hereafter: Wikipedia has a rich set of methods to handle most abuses that commonly arise.
These methods are well-tested and should be relied upon.
In addition, new users may initially find that their votes are given less weight by editors in some informal polls in order to prevent abuse of single- purpose accounts.
As well as systems to catch and control substandard and vandalistic edits, Wikipedia also has a full style and content manual and a variety of positive systems for continual article review and improvement.
Examples of the processes include peer review, good article assessment, and the featured article process, a rigorous review of articles that are intended to meet the highest standards and showcase Wikipedia's capability to produce high-quality work.
In addition, specific types of article or fields often have their own specialized and comprehensive projects, assessment processes , and expert reviewers within specific subjects.
Nominated articles are also frequently the subject of specific focus on the neutral point of view noticeboard or in WikiProject Cleanup.
Wikipedia uses MediaWiki software, the open-source program used not only on Wikimedia projects but also on many other third-party websites.

The 3rd Armored Division was "deployed around Damascus." JDW commented that "the Special Forces and the 3rd Armored Division, along with the 1st Armored Division are key elements in the security structure that protects Assad's government.
Any command changes involving those formations have considerable political significance." Post-uprising reporting indicated the 1st Armored Division had historically been at al-Kiswah.
On 29 September 2004, Jane's Defence Weekly reported that Syria had begun to redeploy elements of one or more Syrian Army special forces regiments based in the coastal hills a few kilometres south of Beirut in Lebanon.
A senior Lebanese Army officer told JDW that the 3,000 troops involved would return to Syria.
Cordesman wrote that in 2006 the Syrian Army had "organized two corps that reported to the Land Forces General Staff and the Commander of the Land Force." In 2009 and 2010, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, the Syrian army comprised 220,000 regular personnel, and the entire armed forces had 325,000 regular troops.
In 2013, Agence France Press wrote on 'Syria's diminished security forces.' At October 1, 2011, according to high-ranking defected Syrian Colonel Riad Assaad, 10,000 soldiers, including high-ranking officers, had deserted the Syrian Army.
Some of these defectors had formed the Free Syrian Army, engaging in combat with security forces and soldiers in what would turn into the Syrian Civil War.
At 16 November 2011, Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, however estimated that less than 1,000 soldiers had deserted the Syrian Army; at the same moment, an FSA battalion commander claimed that the FSA embraced 25,000 army deserters.
Also in November 2011, the Free Syrian Army or the website of France 24 estimated the Syrian Army at 200,000 troops.
According to General Mustafa al-Sheikh, one of the most senior defectors, however, in January 2012 the Syrian forces were estimated at 280,000 including conscripts.
By March 15, 2012, many more soldiers, unhappy with crackdowns on pro- democracy protesters, switched sides and a Turkish official said that 60,000 soldiers had deserted the Syrian army, including 20,000 since February 20.
It was added that most of the deserters were junior officers and soldiers.
By 5 July 2012, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated "tens of thousands" soldiers to have defected.
By August 2012, 40 Brigadier generals from the Army had defected to the opposition army, out of a total of 1,200 generals.
On June 14, 2013, 73 Syrian Army officers and their families, some 202 people in total, sought refuge in Turkey.
Amongst their number were seven generals and 20 colonels.
By August 2013, the strength of the Syrian army had, compared with 2010, roughly been cut in half, due to defections, desertions and casualties, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London: it now counted 110,000 troops.
Up until July 2012, the scale of defections from the Syrian Army, though hard to quantify, was too small to make an impact on the strength of that army, according to Aram Nerguizian from the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Strategically important units of the Syrian armed forces are always controlled by Alawite officers; defecting soldiers – by July 2012 "tens of thousands" according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights – are mainly Sunni without access to vital command and control, Nerguizian said.
Analyst Joseph Holliday wrote in 2013 that "the Assad government has from the beginning of the conflict been unable to mobilize all of its forces without risking largescale defections.
The single greatest liability that the Assad regime has faced in employing its forces has been the challenge of relying on units to carry out orders to brutalize the opposition." This has resulted in Bashar's following his father's precedent by attaching regular army units to more reliable forces .
When Hafez al-Assad directed the suppression of revolts in Hama in 1982, this technique was also used.
The Syrian Arab Army suffers from serious recruitment issues as the Syrian Civil War drags on, with military age men across sectarian lines no longer willing to join or serve their conscription terms.
These issues are especially notable among the Druze population, who have clashed with regime security forces and broken Druze youths out of regime imprisonment to avoid them serving in the army.
Increasingly, Assad's Alawite base of support refuse to send their sons to the military due to massive casualty rates among military age men in their community; a third of 250,000 Alawite men of fighting age have been killed in the Syrian Civil War, leading to major tensions between the sect and the Assad regime.
As of mid-2018, then-Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that the Syrian Arab Army had regained its pre-2011 strength levels, recovering from manpower shortages earlier in the Syrian Civil War.
The 3rd Armored Division has deployed elements of three brigades from its bases around Qutayfah to Deraa, Zabadani, and Hama, while the 11th Armored Division has stayed close to its bases in Homs and Hama.
The European Council named Major General Wajih Mahmud as commander of the 18th Armored Division in the Official Journal of the European Union on 15 November 2011, sanctioning him for violence committed in Homs.
Henry Boyd of the IISS noted that "in Homs, the 18th Armored Division was reinforced by Special Forces units and ...

Empowering ministers with sole financial initiative had an immediate and lasting impact.
Apart from achieving its intended purpose – to stabilise the budgetary process – it gave the Crown a leadership role in the Commons; and, the Lord Treasurer assumed a leading position among ministers.
The power of financial initiative was not, however, absolute.
Only Ministers might initiate money bills, but Parliament now reviewed and consented to them.
Standing Order 66 therefore represents the beginnings of Ministerial responsibility and accountability.
The term "prime minister" appears at this time as an unofficial title for the leader of the government, usually the Head of the Treasury.
Jonathan Swift, for example, wrote that in 1713 there had been "those who are now commonly called Prime Minister among us", referring to Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin and Robert Harley, Queen Anne's Lord Treasurers and chief ministers.
Since 1721, every head of the Sovereign's government – with one exception in the 18th century and one in the 19th – has been First Lord of the Treasury.
Political parties first appeared during the Exclusion Crisis of 1678–1681.
The Whigs, who believed in limited monarchy, wanted to exclude James, Duke of York, from succeeding to the throne because he was a Roman Catholic.
The Tories, who believed in the "Divine Right of Kings", defended James's hereditary claim.
Political parties were not well organised or disciplined in the 17th century.
They were more like factions, with "members" drifting in and out, collaborating temporarily on issues when it was to their advantage, then disbanding when it was not.
A major deterrent to the development of opposing parties was the idea that there could only be one "King's Party" and to oppose it would be disloyal or even treasonous.
Nevertheless it became possible at the end of the 17th century to identify Parliaments and Ministries as being either "Whig" or "Tory" in composition.
The modern prime minister is also the leader of the Cabinet.
A convention of the constitution, the modern Cabinet is a group of ministers who formulate policies.
As the political heads of government departments Cabinet Ministers ensure that policies are carried out by permanent civil servants.
Although the modern prime minister selects ministers, appointment still rests with the sovereign.
With the prime minister as its leader, the Cabinet forms the executive branch of government.[note 2] The term "Cabinet" first appears after the Revolutionary Settlement to describe those ministers who conferred privately with the sovereign.
The growth of the Cabinet met with widespread complaint and opposition because its meetings were often held in secret and it excluded the ancient Privy Council from the sovereign's circle of advisers, reducing it to an honorary body.
The early Cabinet, like that of today, included the Treasurer and other department heads who sat on the Treasury bench.
However, it might also include individuals who were not members of Parliament such as household officers and members of the royal family.
The exclusion of non-members of Parliament from the Cabinet was essential to the development of ministerial accountability and responsibility.
Both William and Anne appointed and dismissed Cabinet members, attended meetings, made decisions, and followed up on actions.
Relieving the Sovereign of these responsibilities and gaining control over the Cabinet's composition was an essential part of evolution of the Premiership.
This process began after the Hanoverian Succession.
Although George I attended Cabinet meetings at first, after 1717 he withdrew because he did not speak fluent English and was bored with the discussions.
George II occasionally presided at Cabinet meetings but his successor, George III , is known to have attended only two during his 60-year reign.
Thus, the convention that sovereigns do not attend Cabinet meetings was established primarily through royal indifference to the everyday tasks of governance.
The prime minister became responsible for calling meetings, presiding, taking notes, and reporting to the Sovereign.
A redirect is left at the old category name, and this is not a normal `#REDIRECT [[...]]` but a category redirect.
Once all the pages have been moved out of the old category, it may be left as a category redirect or deleted.
For categories entirely populated through templates , modifying the templates enables all affected articles to be moved to another category, but with the refresh problem mentioned.
Almost all category name changes are made pursuant to a consensus decision at Wikipedia:Categories for discussion.
Do not create intercategory redirects other than with a category redirect template.
See Wikipedia:Categories for discussion#Redirecting categories for more on category redirects.
When the magic word `_HIDDENCAT` is placed on a category page, that category becomes hidden , meaning that it will not be displayed on the pages belonging to that category.
On Wikipedia, the magic word is not normally used explicitly, but is applied through the hidden categorytemplate.
The feature is mostly used to prevent project maintenance categories from showing up to ordinary readers on article pages.
However, hidden categories are displayed : Hidden categories are automatically added to Category:Hidden categories.
For guidelines on the hiding of categories on Wikipedia, see WP:HIDDENCAT.
The most effective way of finding entries of a category is using the "What links here" tool on the category's main article.
An easy way to find relevant articles for a new category or missing entries in an existing one is by finding the most relevant list and checking its entries.
Sometimes categories are about things that are intersections of other categories for which the PetScan tool can be used.
More relevant articles may also be found linked in a category's main article and the articles already featured in the category − especially in their "See also" sections and the automatically suggested "RELATED ARTICLES" below them.
Furthermore, a category's superordinate categories often feature articles that should be subcategorized to the category.
Other ways to find relevant articles include searching Wikipedia for the category's topic and searching the Web for the topic in quotes `"` and appending the word `wiki` or `Wikipedia` or `site:Wikipedia.org` to them.
Templates are categorized the same way as articles, except that `[[Category: Some-topic templates]]` should be placed on the template's documentation page , this is necessary to avoid categorizing pages by template inclusion .
A template can be used to add pages to a category, usually by placing the category link inside < includeonly></includeonly> tags on the template .
When the template is transcluded into the page, the category link becomes active, and the page is added to the category page.
This is useful for categories that have high turnover or many pages included, like cleanup categories.
Changes to the template, however, may not be reflected immediately on the category page.
When you edit an article to add a category tag directly, the list of category members is updated immediately when the page is saved.
When a category link is contained in a template, however, this does not happen immediately: instead, whenever a template is edited, all the pages that transclude it are put into the job queue to be recached during periods of low server load.
This means that, in busy periods, it may take hours or even days before individual pages are recached and they start to appear in the category list.
Performing a null edit to a page will allow it to jump the queue and be immediately recached.
The new system of government formally came into place after the 2018 general election, where Erdoğan and the new AKP-MHP People's Alliance was re-elected.
He has since been tackling, but also accused of contributing to, the Turkish currency and debt crisis of 2018, which has caused a significant decline in his popularity and is widely believed to have contributed to his loss in the 2019 local elections in which the ruling party lost control of Ankara and Istanbul for the first time in 25 years.
After the loss, the Turkish government ordered a re-election in Istanbul, in which the ruling party lost the elections again with an even greater margin.
The two successive losses was seen as a huge blow to Erdoğan, who had once said that if his party "lost Istanbul, we would lose Turkey," and has been called to be the "beginning of the end" of him.
Erdoğan ranked first in the World's 500 Most Influential Muslims 2019 list from the Jordan-based Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre.
Erdoğan was born in the Kasımpaşa, a poor neighborhood of Istanbul, to which his family had moved from Rize Province in the 1930's.
His parents were Ahmet Erdoğan and Tenzile Erdoğan .
Erdoğan spent his early childhood in Rize, where his father was a captain in the Turkish Coast Guard.
His summer holidays were mostly spent in Güneysu, Rize, where his family originates.
Throughout his life he often returned to this spiritual home, and in 2015 he opened a vast mosque on a mountaintop near this village.
The family returned to Istanbul when Erdoğan was 13 years old.
As a teenager, Erdoğan's father provided him with a weekly allowance of 2.5 Turkish lira, less than a dollar.
With it, Erdogan bought postcards and resold them on the street.
He sold bottles of water to drivers stuck in traffic.
Erdogan also worked as a street vendor selling sesame bread rings called simit.
Erdogan wore a white gown, selling simit from a red three-wheel cart with simit rolls stacked behind glass.
In his youth, Erdoğan played semi- professional football at a local club.
Fenerbahçe wanted him to transfer to the club but his father prevented it.
The stadium of the local football club in the district where he grew up, Kasımpaşa S.K.
Erdoğan is a member of the Community of İskenderpaşa, a Turkish sufistic community of Naqshbandi tariqah.
Erdoğan graduated from Kasımpaşa Piyale primary school in 1965, and İmam Hatip school, a religious vocational high school, in 1973.
One quarter of the curriculum of Imam Hatip schools involves study of the Quran, the life of Islamic prophet Muhammad, and the Arabic language.
Erdogan's classmates began calling him "hoca", which means "Muslim teacher".
Erdogan attended a meeting of a nationalist student group called "Milli Turk Talebe Birligi".
The group sought to raise a conservative cohort of young people to counter the rising movement of leftists in Turkey.
Erdogan was distinguished by his oratorical skills.
He developed a penchant for public speaking and excelled in front of an audience.
He won first place in a poetry- reading competition organized by the Community of Turkish Technical Painters.
He acquired skills of critical thinking, preparing for his speeches through reading and research.
When required, protection should be implemented for only a brief period, not exceeding the duration of the block.
Confirmed socks of registered users should be dealt with in accordance with Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry; their pages are not normally protected.
Base user pages are automatically protected from creation or editing by unconfirmed and IP users.
An exception to this includes an unconfirmed registered user attempting to edit their own user page.
IP and unconfirmed editors are also unable to create or edit user pages that do not belong to a registered user.
Users may opt-out of this protection by placing unlocked userpage anywhere on their own page.
User pages and subpages may be protected upon a request from the user, as long as a need exists—pages in user space should not be automatically or pre- emptively protected.
Requests for protection specifically at uncommon levels may be granted if the user has expressed a genuine and realistic need.
When a filter is insufficient to stop user page vandalism, a user may choose to create a ".css" subpage , copy all the contents of their user page onto the subpage, transclude the subpage by putting User:Example/Userpage.csson their user page, and then ask an administrator to fully protect their user page.
Because user space pages that end in ".css", ".js", and ".json" are editable only by the user to which that user space belongs , this will protect your user page from further vandalism.
In the event of the confirmed death of a user, the user's user page should be fully protected.
Highly visible templates, which are used on an extremely large number of pages or substituted with great frequency, are often semi- or template-protected based on the degree of visibility, type of use, content, etc.
Protected templates should normally have the documentationtemplate.
It loads the unprotected `/doc` page, so that non-admins and IP-users can edit the documentation, categories and interwiki links.
It also automatically adds pp-templateto protected templates, which displays a small padlock in the top right corner and categorizes the template as protected.
Only manually add pp-templateto protected templates that don't use documentation.
Cascading protection should generally not be applied directly to templates, as it will not protect transclusions inside `<includeonly>` tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters, but will protect the template's documentation subpage.
Instead, consider any of the following: Note: All editnotice templates are already protected via MediaWiki:Titleblacklist.
They can be edited by admins, template editors and page movers only.
Sandboxes should not ordinarily be protected since their purpose is to let new users test and experiment with wiki syntax.
Most sandboxes are automatically cleaned every 12 hours, although they are frequently overwritten by other testing users.
Those who use sandboxes for malicious purposes, or to violate policies such as no personal attacks, civility, or copyrights, should instead be warned and/or blocked.
The following templates may be added at the very top of a page to indicate that it is protected: On redirect pages, use the Redirect category shelltemplate, which automatically categorizes by protection level, below the redirect line.
