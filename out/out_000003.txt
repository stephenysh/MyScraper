This protection level should be used almost exclusively on high-risk templates and modules.
In cases where pages in other namespaces become transcluded to a very high degree, this protection level is also valid.
This is a protection level that replaces full protection on pages that are merely protected due to high transclusion rates, rather than content disputes.
It should be used on templates whose risk factor would have otherwise warranted full protection.
It should not be used on less risky templates on the grounds that the template editor user right exists—the existence of the right should not result in more templates becoming uneditable for the general editing community.
Editors may request edits to a template-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the `{{Edit template-protected}}` template if necessary to gain attention.
Semi-protection prevents edits from unregistered users , as well as edits from any account that is not autoconfirmed or confirmed.
This level of protection is useful when there is a significant amount of disruption or vandalism from new or unregistered users, or to prevent sockpuppets of blocked or banned users from editing, especially when it occurs on biographies of living persons who have had a recent high level of media interest.
An alternative to semi-protection is pending changes, which is sometimes favored when an article is being vandalized regularly, but otherwise receives a low amount of editing.
Such users can request edits to a semi-protected page by proposing them on its talk page, using the `{{Edit semi-protected}}` template if necessary to gain attention.
If the page in question and its talk page are both protected, please make your edit request at Wikipedia:Request for edit instead.
New users may also request the `confirmed` user right by visiting Requests for permissions.
Administrators may apply indefinite semi-protection to pages that are subject to heavy and persistent vandalism or violations of content policy .
Semi- protection should not be used as a preemptive measure against vandalism that has not yet occurred, nor should it be used to privilege registered users over unregistered users in content disputes.
In addition, administrators may apply temporary semi-protection on pages that are: Today's featured article may be semi-protected just like any other article.
But since that article is subject to sudden spurts of vandalism during certain times of day, administrators should semi-protect it for brief periods in most instances.
For the former guideline, see Wikipedia:Main Page featured article protection.
Administrators can prevent the creation of a page through the protection interface.
This is useful for bad articles that have been deleted but repeatedly recreated.
There are several levels of creation protection that can be applied to pages, identical to the levels for edit protection.
A list of protected titles may be found at Special:Protectedtitles .
Philip Randolph on the March on Washington Movement in 1941 to press for an end to racial discrimination in employment.
Rustin later organized Freedom Rides and helped to organize the Southern Christian Leadership Conference to strengthen Martin Luther King Jr.'s leadership, teaching King about nonviolence and later serving as an organizer for the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.
After the passage of the civil rights legislation of 1964–65, Rustin became the head of the AFL–CIO's A.
Philip Randolph Institute, which promoted the integration of formerly all-white unions and promoted the unionization of African Americans.
During the 1970s and 1980s, Rustin served on many humanitarian missions, such as aiding refugees from Communist Vietnam and Cambodia.
At the time of his death in 1987, he was on a humanitarian mission in Haiti.
Rustin was a gay man who had been arrested early in his career for engaging in public sex.
Due to criticism over his sexuality, he usually acted as an influential adviser behind the scenes to civil-rights leaders.
In the 1980s, he became a public advocate on behalf of gay causes.
Later in life, while still devoted to securing workers' rights, Rustin joined other union leaders in aligning with ideological neoconservatism, for which President Ronald Reagan posthumously praised him after his death in 1987.
On November 20, 2013, President Barack Obama posthumously awarded Rustin the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
Rustin was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania, to Florence Rustin and Archie Hopkins, but raised by his maternal grandparents, Julia and Janifer Rustin, as the ninth of their twelve children; growing up he believed his biological mother was his older sister.
His grandparents were relatively wealthy local caterers who raised Rustin in a large house.
Julia Rustin was a Quaker, although she attended her husband's African Methodist Episcopal Church.
She was also a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People .
Du Bois and James Weldon Johnson were frequent guests in the Rustin home.
With these influences in his early life, in his youth Rustin campaigned against racially discriminatory Jim Crow laws.
This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter.
Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of malice , brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity.
Involuntary manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent, recklessness.
Most societies consider murder to be an extremely serious crime, and thus that a person convicted of murder should receive harsh punishments for the purposes of retribution, deterrence, rehabilitation, or incapacitation.
In most countries, a person convicted of murder generally faces a long-term prison sentence, possibly a life sentence; and in a few, the death penalty may be imposed.
The modern English word "murder" descends from the Proto-Indo-European "mrtró" which meant "to die".
The Middle English mordre is a noun from Anglo- Saxon morðor and Old French murdre.
Middle English mordre is a verb from Anglo-Saxon myrdrian and the Middle English noun.
In many countries, in news reports, out of concern for being accused of defamation, journalists are generally careful not to identify a suspect as a murderer until the suspect is convicted of homicide.
After arrest, for example, journalists may instead write that the person was "arrested on suspicion of murder", or, after a prosecutor files charges, as an "accused murderer".
The eighteenth-century English jurist William Blackstone , in his Commentaries on the Laws of England set out the common law definition of murder, which by this definition occurs The elements of common law murder are: The four states of mind recognized as constituting "malice" are: Under state of mind , intent to kill, the deadly weapon rule applies.
Thus, if the defendant intentionally uses a deadly weapon or instrument against the victim, such use authorizes a permissive inference of intent to kill.
Examples of deadly weapons and instruments include but are not limited to guns, knives, deadly toxins or chemicals or gases and even vehicles when intentionally used to harm one or more victims.
Under state of mind , an "abandoned and malignant heart", the killing must result from the defendant's conduct involving a reckless indifference to human life and a conscious disregard of an unreasonable risk of death or serious bodily injury.
In Australian jurisdictions, the unreasonable risk must amount to a foreseen probability of death , as opposed to possibility.
Under state of mind , the felony-murder doctrine, the felony committed must be an inherently dangerous felony, such as burglary, arson, rape, robbery or kidnapping.
Along with the Vatican City and San Marino, it is one of only three independent states completely surrounded by the territory of another country, and the only one outside of the Italian peninsula.
Lesotho is just over 30,000 km2 in size and has a population of around 2 million.
Lesotho was previously the British Crown Colony of Basutoland, but it declared independence from the United Kingdom on 4 October 1966.
It is now a fully sovereign state that is a member of the United Nations, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Southern African Development Community .
The name Lesotho roughly translates to "the land of the people who speak Sesotho".
The original inhabitants of the area now known as Lesotho were the San people.
Examples of their rock art can be found in the mountains throughout the area.
Modern Lesotho, then called Basutoland, emerged as a single polity under King Moshoeshoe I in 1822.
Moshoeshoe, a son of Mokhachane, a minor chief of the Bakoteli lineage, formed his own clan and became a chief around 1804.
Between 1821 and 1823, he and his followers settled at the Butha-Buthe Mountain, joining with former adversaries in resistance against the Lifaqane associated with the reign of Shaka Zulu from 1818 to 1828.
Further evolution of the state emerged out of conflicts between British and Dutch colonists leaving the Cape Colony following its seizure from the French- allied Dutch by the British in 1795, and also from the Orange River Sovereignty and subsequent Orange Free State.
Missionaries invited by Moshoeshoe I, Thomas Arbousset, Eugène Casalis and Constant Gosselin from the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society, placed at Morija, developed orthography and printed works in the Sesotho language between 1837 and 1855.
Casalis, acting as translator and providing advice on foreign affairs, helped to set up diplomatic channels and acquire guns for use against the encroaching Europeans and the Griqua people.
Trekboers from the Cape Colony arrived on the western borders of Basutoland and claimed rights to its land, the first of which being Jan de Winnaar, who settled in the Matlakeng area in May–June 1838.
As more Boers were moving into the area they tried to colonise the land between the two rivers and even north of the Caledon, claiming that it had been abandoned by the Sotho people.
Moshoeshoe subsequently signed a treaty with the British Governor of the Cape Colony, Sir George Thomas Napier, that annexed the Orange River Sovereignty that many Boers had settled.
These outraged Boers were suppressed in a brief skirmish in 1848.
In 1851 a British force was defeated by the Basotho army at Kolonyama, provoking an embarrassing war for the British.
After repelling another British attack in 1852, Moshoeshoe sent an appeal to the British commander that settled the dispute diplomatically, and then defeated the Batlokoa in 1853.
In 1854 the British pulled out of the region, and in 1858 Moshoeshoe fought a series of wars with the Boers in what is known as the Free State–Basotho War.
As a result Moshoeshoe lost a great portion of the western lowlands.
The last war with the Boers in 1867 ended when Moshoeshoe appealed to Queen Victoria, who agreed to make Basutoland a British protectorate in 1868.
In 1869, the British signed a treaty at Aliwal North with the Boers that defined the boundaries of Basutoland, and later Lesotho.
Wikipedia content is intended to be factual, notable, verifiable with cited external sources, and neutrally presented.
The appropriate policies and guidelines for these are found at: These are often abbreviated to WP:NOT, WP:NPOV, WP:NOR, WP:V, WP:RS, WP:CITE, and WP:MOS respectively.
The Wikipedia community is largely self-organising, so that anyone may build a reputation as a competent editor and become involved in any role s/he may choose, subject to peer approval.
Individuals often will choose to become involved in specialised tasks, such as reviewing articles at others' request, watching current edits for vandalism, watching newly created articles for quality control purposes, or similar roles.
Editors who believe they can serve the community better by taking on additional administrative responsibility may ask their peers for agreement to undertake such responsibilities.
This structure enforces meritocracy and communal standards of editorship and conduct.
At present a minimum approval of 75–80% from the community is required to take on these additional tools and responsibilities.
This standard tends to ensure a high level of experience, trust, and familiarity across a broad front of aspects within Wikipedia.
A variety of software-assisted systems and automated programs help editors and administrators to watch for problematic edits and editors.
Theoretically all editors and users are treated equally with no "power structure".
There is, however, a hierarchy of permissions and positions, some of which are listed hereafter: Wikipedia has a rich set of methods to handle most abuses that commonly arise.
These methods are well-tested and should be relied upon.
In addition, new users may initially find that their votes are given less weight by editors in some informal polls in order to prevent abuse of single- purpose accounts.
As well as systems to catch and control substandard and vandalistic edits, Wikipedia also has a full style and content manual and a variety of positive systems for continual article review and improvement.
Examples of the processes include peer review, good article assessment, and the featured article process, a rigorous review of articles that are intended to meet the highest standards and showcase Wikipedia's capability to produce high-quality work.
In addition, specific types of article or fields often have their own specialized and comprehensive projects, assessment processes , and expert reviewers within specific subjects.
Several of the tabletop games – primarily Vampire: The Masquerade and Hunter: The Reckoning – have been adapted into video games by different developers, covering several genres including role-playing games, action games, and adventure games.
Critical reception of the games has varied, ranging from average to positive, with Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines standing out, being described by video game publications as a cult classic and a "flawed masterpiece".
Video game adaptations of the series began with two Werewolf: The Apocalypse games in the 1990s that were never completed; the first released video game in the series was 2000's Vampire: The Masquerade – Redemption , which was followed by three Hunter games in 2002–2003, and Bloodlines in 2004.
Following this, no further World of Darkness video games were released in over a decade, with another Werewolf project and the online game World of Darkness started and canceled in the meantime until 2017's World of Darkness Preludes , which was based on Vampire and Mage: The Ascension.
Since then, several video games have been announced, including Werewolf: The Apocalypse – Earthblood and the three Vampire games Coteries of New York , Bloodlines 2 , and Swansong.
Denmark ratified the convention on 25 July 1979, making its historical sites eligible for inclusion on the list.
The first site in Denmark to be added to the list was Jelling Mounds, Runic Stones and Church, inscribed at the 18th Session of the World Heritage Committee, held in 1994 in Phuket, Thailand.
