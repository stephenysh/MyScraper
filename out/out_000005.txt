In 1939, he was in the chorus of a short-lived musical that starred Paul Robeson.
Blues singer Josh White was also a cast member, and later invited Rustin to join his band, "Josh White and the Carolinians".
This gave Rustin the opportunity to become a regular performer at the Café Society nightclub in Greenwich Village, widening his social and intellectual contacts.
A few albums on Fellowship Records featuring his singing were produced from the 1950s through the 1970s.
Rustin's personal philosophy is said to have been inspired by combining Quaker pacifism with socialism and the theory of non-violent protest, popularized by Mahatma Gandhi.
At the direction of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party USA and its members were active in the civil rights movement for African Americans.
The CPUSA, at the time following Stalin's "theory of nationalism", favored the creation of a separate nation for African-Americans to be located in the American Southeast where the greatest proportion of the black population was concentrated.
In 1941, after Germany invaded the Soviet Union, Communist International ordered the CPUSA to abandon civil rights work and focus on supporting U.S.
Disillusioned, Rustin began working with members of the Socialist Party of Norman Thomas, particularly A.
Philip Randolph, the head of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters; another socialist mentor was the pacifist A.
Muste, leader of the Fellowship of Reconciliation .
FOR hired Rustin as a race relation secretary in the late summer of 1941.
The three of them proposed a march on Washington in 1941 to protest racial segregation in the armed forces and widespread discrimination in employment.
Meeting with President Roosevelt in the Oval Office, Randolph respectfully and politely, but firmly told President Roosevelt that African Americans would march in the capital unless desegregation occurred.
Importantly, the underlying felony cannot be a lesser included offense such as assault, otherwise all criminal homicides would be murder as all are felonies.
In Spanish criminal law, murder takes place when any of these requirements concur: Treachery , price or reward or viciousness .
After the last reform of the Spanish Criminal Code, in force since July 1, 2015, another circumstance that turns homicide into murder is the desire to facilitate the commission of another crime or to prevent it from being discovered.
As with most legal terms, the precise definition of murder varies between jurisdictions and is usually codified in some form of legislation.
Even when the legal distinction between murder and manslaughter is clear, it is not unknown for a jury to find a murder defendant guilty of the lesser offense.
The jury might sympathize with the defendant , and the jury may wish to protect the defendant from a sentence of life imprisonment or execution.
The distinction between first- and second-degree murder exists, for example, in Canadian murder law and U.S.
The most common division is between first- and second-degree murder.
Generally, second-degree murder is common law murder, and first-degree is an aggravated form.
The aggravating factors of first-degree murder depend on the jurisdiction, but may include a specific intent to kill, premeditation, or deliberation.
In some, murder committed by acts such as strangulation, poisoning, or lying in wait are also treated as first-degree murder.
further distinguish third-degree murder, but they differ significantly in which kinds of murders they classify as second-degree versus third-degree.
For example, Minnesota defines third-degree murder as depraved- heart murder, whereas Florida defines third-degree murder as felony murder .
Some jurisdictions also distinguish premeditated murder.
This is the crime of wrongfully and intentionally causing the death of another human being after rationally considering the timing or method of doing so, in order to either increase the likelihood of success, or to evade detection or apprehension.
State laws in the United States vary as to definitions of "premeditation".
In some states, premeditation may be construed as taking place mere seconds before the murder.
This treaty effectively reduced Moshoeshoe's kingdom to half its previous size by ceding away the western territories of Basutoland.
Following the cession in 1869, the British transferred functions from Moshoeshoe's capital in Thaba Bosiu to a police camp on the northwest border, Maseru, until eventually the administration of Basutoland was transferred to the Cape Colony in 1871.
Moshoeshoe died on 11 March 1870, marking the end of the traditional era and the beginning of the colonial era of Basutoland.
In the early years of British rule between 1871 and 1884, Basutoland was treated similarly to other territories that had been forcibly annexed, much to the humiliation of the Basotho, leading to a Gun War in 1881.
In 1884, Basutoland was restored to its status as a protectorate, with Maseru again its capital, but remained under direct rule by a governor, though effective internal power was wielded by traditional chiefs.
Basutoland gained its independence from Britain and became the Kingdom of Lesotho in 1966.
In January 1970, the ruling Basotho National Party lost the first post- independence general elections, with 23 seats to the Basutoland Congress Party's 36.
Prime Minister Leabua Jonathan refused to cede power to the Basotho Congress Party , and instead declared himself Tona Kholo , and imprisoned the BCP leadership.
BCP began a rebellion and then received training in Libya for its Lesotho Liberation Army under the pretense of being Azanian People's Liberation Army soldiers of the Pan Africanist Congress .
Deprived of arms and supplies by the Sibeko faction of the PAC in 1978, the 178-strong LLA was rescued from their Tanzanian base by the financial assistance of a Maoist PAC officer, but they launched the guerrilla war with only a handful of old weapons.
The main force was defeated in northern Lesotho, and later guerrillas launched sporadic but usually ineffectual attacks.
The campaign was severely compromised when BCP's leader, Ntsu Mokhehle, went to Pretoria.
In the early 1980s, several Basotho who sympathised with the exiled BCP were threatened with death and attacked by the government of Leabua Jonathan.
On 4 September 1981, the family of Benjamin Masilo was attacked.
Exactly four days later, Edgar Mahlomola Motuba, the editor of the popular newspaper Leselinyana la Lesotho, was abducted from his home together with two friends and murdered.
What later ensued was a de facto government led by Dr.
Leabua Jonathan until 1986 when a military coup forced it out of office.
The Transitional Military Council that came to power granted executive powers to King Moshoeshoe II, who was until then a ceremonial monarch.
But in 1987 the King was forced into exile after coming up with a six-page memorandum on how he wanted the Lesotho's constitution to be, which would have given him more executive powers than the military government had originally agreed to.
His son was installed as King Letsie III in his place.
The chairman of the military junta, Major General Justin Metsing Lekhanya, was ousted in 1991 and replaced by Major General Elias Phisoana Ramaema, who handed over power to a democratically elected government of the BCP in 1993.
Moshoeshoe II returned from exile in 1992 as an ordinary citizen.
After the return to democratic government, King Letsie III tried unsuccessfully to persuade the BCP government to reinstate his father as head of state.
In August 1994, Letsie III staged a military-backed coup that deposed the BCP government, after the BCP government refused to reinstate his father, Moshoeshoe II, according to Lesotho's constitution.
The new government did not receive full international recognition.
Member states of the Southern African Development Community engaged in negotiations to reinstate the BCP government.
