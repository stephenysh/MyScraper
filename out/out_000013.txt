The term "prime minister" appears at this time as an unofficial title for the leader of the government, usually the Head of the Treasury.
Jonathan Swift, for example, wrote that in 1713 there had been "those who are now commonly called Prime Minister among us", referring to Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin and Robert Harley, Queen Anne's Lord Treasurers and chief ministers.
Since 1721, every head of the Sovereign's government – with one exception in the 18th century and one in the 19th – has been First Lord of the Treasury.
Political parties first appeared during the Exclusion Crisis of 1678–1681.
The Whigs, who believed in limited monarchy, wanted to exclude James, Duke of York, from succeeding to the throne because he was a Roman Catholic.
The Tories, who believed in the "Divine Right of Kings", defended James's hereditary claim.
Political parties were not well organised or disciplined in the 17th century.
They were more like factions, with "members" drifting in and out, collaborating temporarily on issues when it was to their advantage, then disbanding when it was not.
A major deterrent to the development of opposing parties was the idea that there could only be one "King's Party" and to oppose it would be disloyal or even treasonous.
Nevertheless it became possible at the end of the 17th century to identify Parliaments and Ministries as being either "Whig" or "Tory" in composition.
The modern prime minister is also the leader of the Cabinet.
A convention of the constitution, the modern Cabinet is a group of ministers who formulate policies.
As the political heads of government departments Cabinet Ministers ensure that policies are carried out by permanent civil servants.
Although the modern prime minister selects ministers, appointment still rests with the sovereign.
With the prime minister as its leader, the Cabinet forms the executive branch of government.[note 2] The term "Cabinet" first appears after the Revolutionary Settlement to describe those ministers who conferred privately with the sovereign.
The growth of the Cabinet met with widespread complaint and opposition because its meetings were often held in secret and it excluded the ancient Privy Council from the sovereign's circle of advisers, reducing it to an honorary body.
The early Cabinet, like that of today, included the Treasurer and other department heads who sat on the Treasury bench.
However, it might also include individuals who were not members of Parliament such as household officers and members of the royal family.
The exclusion of non-members of Parliament from the Cabinet was essential to the development of ministerial accountability and responsibility.
Both William and Anne appointed and dismissed Cabinet members, attended meetings, made decisions, and followed up on actions.
Relieving the Sovereign of these responsibilities and gaining control over the Cabinet's composition was an essential part of evolution of the Premiership.
This process began after the Hanoverian Succession.
Although George I attended Cabinet meetings at first, after 1717 he withdrew because he did not speak fluent English and was bored with the discussions.
George II occasionally presided at Cabinet meetings but his successor, George III , is known to have attended only two during his 60-year reign.
Thus, the convention that sovereigns do not attend Cabinet meetings was established primarily through royal indifference to the everyday tasks of governance.
The prime minister became responsible for calling meetings, presiding, taking notes, and reporting to the Sovereign.
A redirect is left at the old category name, and this is not a normal `#REDIRECT [[...]]` but a category redirect.
Once all the pages have been moved out of the old category, it may be left as a category redirect or deleted.
For categories entirely populated through templates , modifying the templates enables all affected articles to be moved to another category, but with the refresh problem mentioned.
Almost all category name changes are made pursuant to a consensus decision at Wikipedia:Categories for discussion.
Do not create intercategory redirects other than with a category redirect template.
See Wikipedia:Categories for discussion#Redirecting categories for more on category redirects.
When the magic word `_HIDDENCAT` is placed on a category page, that category becomes hidden , meaning that it will not be displayed on the pages belonging to that category.
On Wikipedia, the magic word is not normally used explicitly, but is applied through the hidden categorytemplate.
The feature is mostly used to prevent project maintenance categories from showing up to ordinary readers on article pages.
However, hidden categories are displayed : Hidden categories are automatically added to Category:Hidden categories.
For guidelines on the hiding of categories on Wikipedia, see WP:HIDDENCAT.
The most effective way of finding entries of a category is using the "What links here" tool on the category's main article.
An easy way to find relevant articles for a new category or missing entries in an existing one is by finding the most relevant list and checking its entries.
Sometimes categories are about things that are intersections of other categories for which the PetScan tool can be used.
More relevant articles may also be found linked in a category's main article and the articles already featured in the category − especially in their "See also" sections and the automatically suggested "RELATED ARTICLES" below them.
Furthermore, a category's superordinate categories often feature articles that should be subcategorized to the category.
Other ways to find relevant articles include searching Wikipedia for the category's topic and searching the Web for the topic in quotes `"` and appending the word `wiki` or `Wikipedia` or `site:Wikipedia.org` to them.
Templates are categorized the same way as articles, except that `[[Category: Some-topic templates]]` should be placed on the template's documentation page , this is necessary to avoid categorizing pages by template inclusion .
A template can be used to add pages to a category, usually by placing the category link inside < includeonly></includeonly> tags on the template .
When the template is transcluded into the page, the category link becomes active, and the page is added to the category page.
This is useful for categories that have high turnover or many pages included, like cleanup categories.
Changes to the template, however, may not be reflected immediately on the category page.
When you edit an article to add a category tag directly, the list of category members is updated immediately when the page is saved.
When a category link is contained in a template, however, this does not happen immediately: instead, whenever a template is edited, all the pages that transclude it are put into the job queue to be recached during periods of low server load.
This means that, in busy periods, it may take hours or even days before individual pages are recached and they start to appear in the category list.
Performing a null edit to a page will allow it to jump the queue and be immediately recached.
The new system of government formally came into place after the 2018 general election, where Erdoğan and the new AKP-MHP People's Alliance was re-elected.
He has since been tackling, but also accused of contributing to, the Turkish currency and debt crisis of 2018, which has caused a significant decline in his popularity and is widely believed to have contributed to his loss in the 2019 local elections in which the ruling party lost control of Ankara and Istanbul for the first time in 25 years.
After the loss, the Turkish government ordered a re-election in Istanbul, in which the ruling party lost the elections again with an even greater margin.
The two successive losses was seen as a huge blow to Erdoğan, who had once said that if his party "lost Istanbul, we would lose Turkey," and has been called to be the "beginning of the end" of him.
Erdoğan ranked first in the World's 500 Most Influential Muslims 2019 list from the Jordan-based Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre.
Erdoğan was born in the Kasımpaşa, a poor neighborhood of Istanbul, to which his family had moved from Rize Province in the 1930's.
His parents were Ahmet Erdoğan and Tenzile Erdoğan .
Erdoğan spent his early childhood in Rize, where his father was a captain in the Turkish Coast Guard.
His summer holidays were mostly spent in Güneysu, Rize, where his family originates.
Throughout his life he often returned to this spiritual home, and in 2015 he opened a vast mosque on a mountaintop near this village.
The family returned to Istanbul when Erdoğan was 13 years old.
As a teenager, Erdoğan's father provided him with a weekly allowance of 2.5 Turkish lira, less than a dollar.
With it, Erdogan bought postcards and resold them on the street.
He sold bottles of water to drivers stuck in traffic.
Erdogan also worked as a street vendor selling sesame bread rings called simit.
Erdogan wore a white gown, selling simit from a red three-wheel cart with simit rolls stacked behind glass.
In his youth, Erdoğan played semi- professional football at a local club.
Fenerbahçe wanted him to transfer to the club but his father prevented it.
The stadium of the local football club in the district where he grew up, Kasımpaşa S.K.
Erdoğan is a member of the Community of İskenderpaşa, a Turkish sufistic community of Naqshbandi tariqah.
Erdoğan graduated from Kasımpaşa Piyale primary school in 1965, and İmam Hatip school, a religious vocational high school, in 1973.
One quarter of the curriculum of Imam Hatip schools involves study of the Quran, the life of Islamic prophet Muhammad, and the Arabic language.
Erdogan's classmates began calling him "hoca", which means "Muslim teacher".
Erdogan attended a meeting of a nationalist student group called "Milli Turk Talebe Birligi".
The group sought to raise a conservative cohort of young people to counter the rising movement of leftists in Turkey.
Erdogan was distinguished by his oratorical skills.
He developed a penchant for public speaking and excelled in front of an audience.
He won first place in a poetry- reading competition organized by the Community of Turkish Technical Painters.
He acquired skills of critical thinking, preparing for his speeches through reading and research.
When required, protection should be implemented for only a brief period, not exceeding the duration of the block.
Confirmed socks of registered users should be dealt with in accordance with Wikipedia:Sockpuppetry; their pages are not normally protected.
Base user pages are automatically protected from creation or editing by unconfirmed and IP users.
An exception to this includes an unconfirmed registered user attempting to edit their own user page.
IP and unconfirmed editors are also unable to create or edit user pages that do not belong to a registered user.
Users may opt-out of this protection by placing unlocked userpage anywhere on their own page.
User pages and subpages may be protected upon a request from the user, as long as a need exists—pages in user space should not be automatically or pre- emptively protected.
Requests for protection specifically at uncommon levels may be granted if the user has expressed a genuine and realistic need.
When a filter is insufficient to stop user page vandalism, a user may choose to create a ".css" subpage , copy all the contents of their user page onto the subpage, transclude the subpage by putting User:Example/Userpage.csson their user page, and then ask an administrator to fully protect their user page.
Because user space pages that end in ".css", ".js", and ".json" are editable only by the user to which that user space belongs , this will protect your user page from further vandalism.
In the event of the confirmed death of a user, the user's user page should be fully protected.
Highly visible templates, which are used on an extremely large number of pages or substituted with great frequency, are often semi- or template-protected based on the degree of visibility, type of use, content, etc.
Protected templates should normally have the documentationtemplate.
It loads the unprotected `/doc` page, so that non-admins and IP-users can edit the documentation, categories and interwiki links.
It also automatically adds pp-templateto protected templates, which displays a small padlock in the top right corner and categorizes the template as protected.
Only manually add pp-templateto protected templates that don't use documentation.
Cascading protection should generally not be applied directly to templates, as it will not protect transclusions inside `<includeonly>` tags or transclusions that depend on template parameters, but will protect the template's documentation subpage.
Instead, consider any of the following: Note: All editnotice templates are already protected via MediaWiki:Titleblacklist.
They can be edited by admins, template editors and page movers only.
