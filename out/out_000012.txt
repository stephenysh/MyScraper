Cascading protection fully protects a page, and extends that full protection automatically to any page that is transcluded onto the protected page, whether directly or indirectly.
This includes templates, images and other media that are hosted on the English Wikipedia.
Files stored on Commons are not protected by any other wiki's cascading protection and must be temporarily uploaded to the English Wikipedia or protected at Commons, either manually or through cascading protection there.
When operational, KrinkleBot cascade-protects Commons files transcluded at Wikipedia:Main Page/Tomorrow, Wikipedia:Main Page/Commons media protection and Main Page.
As the bot's response time varies, media should not be transcluded on the main page until after it has been protected.
Cascading protection: The list of cascading-protected pages can be found at Wikipedia:Cascade- protected items.
Requests to add or remove cascading protection on a page should be made at Wikipedia talk:Cascade-protected items as an edit request.
Superprotect was a level of protection, allowing editing only by Wikimedia Foundation employees who are in the Staff global group.
It was implemented on August 10, 2014 and used the same day to override community consensus regarding the use of the Media Viewer on the German Wikipedia's primary site JavaScript, common.js.
On November 5, 2015, the WMF decided to remove superprotect from all Wikimedia wikis.
Cascading semi-protection was formerly possible, but it was disabled in 2007 after users noticed that non-administrators could fully protect any page by transcluding it onto the page to which cascading semi-protection had been applied by an administrator.
Originally, two levels of pending changes protection existed, where level 2 required edits by all users who are not pending changes reviewers to be reviewed.
Following a community discussion, level 2 was retired from the English Wikipedia in January 2017.
It was suggested then that "Pending changes level 1" be referred to in the future as simply "Pending changes".
Modifications to a protected page can be proposed on its talk page for discussion.
Administrators can make changes to the protected article reflecting consensus.
Placing the Edit protected template on the talk page will draw the attention of administrators for implementing uncontroversial changes.
Talk pages are not usually protected, and are semi-protected only for a limited duration in the most severe cases of vandalism.
User talk pages are rarely protected, and are semi-protected for short durations only in the most severe cases of vandalism from IP users.
Users whose talk pages are semi-protected should have an unprotected user talk subpage linked conspicuously from their main talk page to allow good-faith comments from non-autoconfirmed users.
A user's request to have his or her own talk page protected is not a sufficient rationale by itself to protect the page, although requests may be considered if a reason is provided.
Blocked users' user talk pages should not ordinarily be protected, as this interferes with the user's ability to contest their block through the normal process.
It also prevents others from being able to use the talk page to communicate with the blocked editor.
In extreme cases of abuse by the blocked user, such as abuse of the unblocktemplate, re-blocking the user without talk page access should be preferred over protection.
If the user has been indefinitely blocked from editing the talk page, they should be informed of off-wiki ways to appeal their block, such as the UTRS tool interface or as a last recourse, the Arbitration Committee.
Editors who believe they can serve the community better by taking on additional administrative responsibility may ask their peers for agreement to undertake such responsibilities.
This structure enforces meritocracy and communal standards of editorship and conduct.
At present a minimum approval of 75–80% from the community is required to take on these additional tools and responsibilities.
This standard tends to ensure a high level of experience, trust, and familiarity across a broad front of aspects within Wikipedia.
A variety of software-assisted systems and automated programs help editors and administrators to watch for problematic edits and editors.
Theoretically all editors and users are treated equally with no "power structure".
There is, however, a hierarchy of permissions and positions, some of which are listed hereafter: Wikipedia has a rich set of methods to handle most abuses that commonly arise.
These methods are well-tested and should be relied upon.
In addition, new users may initially find that their votes are given less weight by editors in some informal polls in order to prevent abuse of single- purpose accounts.
As well as systems to catch and control substandard and vandalistic edits, Wikipedia also has a full style and content manual and a variety of positive systems for continual article review and improvement.
Examples of the processes include peer review, good article assessment, and the featured article process, a rigorous review of articles that are intended to meet the highest standards and showcase Wikipedia's capability to produce high-quality work.
In addition, specific types of article or fields often have their own specialized and comprehensive projects, assessment processes , and expert reviewers within specific subjects.
Nominated articles are also frequently the subject of specific focus on the neutral point of view noticeboard or in WikiProject Cleanup.
Wikipedia uses MediaWiki software, the open-source program used not only on Wikimedia projects but also on many other third-party websites.
The hardware supporting the Wikimedia projects is based on several hundred servers in various hosting centers around the world.
Full descriptions of these servers and their roles are available on this Meta-Wiki page.

The 3rd Armored Division was "deployed around Damascus." JDW commented that "the Special Forces and the 3rd Armored Division, along with the 1st Armored Division are key elements in the security structure that protects Assad's government.
Any command changes involving those formations have considerable political significance." Post-uprising reporting indicated the 1st Armored Division had historically been at al-Kiswah.
On 29 September 2004, Jane's Defence Weekly reported that Syria had begun to redeploy elements of one or more Syrian Army special forces regiments based in the coastal hills a few kilometres south of Beirut in Lebanon.
A senior Lebanese Army officer told JDW that the 3,000 troops involved would return to Syria.
Cordesman wrote that in 2006 the Syrian Army had "organized two corps that reported to the Land Forces General Staff and the Commander of the Land Force." In 2009 and 2010, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, the Syrian army comprised 220,000 regular personnel, and the entire armed forces had 325,000 regular troops.
In 2013, Agence France Press wrote on 'Syria's diminished security forces.' At October 1, 2011, according to high-ranking defected Syrian Colonel Riad Assaad, 10,000 soldiers, including high-ranking officers, had deserted the Syrian Army.
Some of these defectors had formed the Free Syrian Army, engaging in combat with security forces and soldiers in what would turn into the Syrian Civil War.
At 16 November 2011, Rami Abdel Rahman, the head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, however estimated that less than 1,000 soldiers had deserted the Syrian Army; at the same moment, an FSA battalion commander claimed that the FSA embraced 25,000 army deserters.
Also in November 2011, the Free Syrian Army or the website of France 24 estimated the Syrian Army at 200,000 troops.
According to General Mustafa al-Sheikh, one of the most senior defectors, however, in January 2012 the Syrian forces were estimated at 280,000 including conscripts.
By March 15, 2012, many more soldiers, unhappy with crackdowns on pro- democracy protesters, switched sides and a Turkish official said that 60,000 soldiers had deserted the Syrian army, including 20,000 since February 20.
It was added that most of the deserters were junior officers and soldiers.
By 5 July 2012, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights estimated "tens of thousands" soldiers to have defected.
By August 2012, 40 Brigadier generals from the Army had defected to the opposition army, out of a total of 1,200 generals.
On June 14, 2013, 73 Syrian Army officers and their families, some 202 people in total, sought refuge in Turkey.
Amongst their number were seven generals and 20 colonels.
By August 2013, the strength of the Syrian army had, compared with 2010, roughly been cut in half, due to defections, desertions and casualties, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London: it now counted 110,000 troops.
Up until July 2012, the scale of defections from the Syrian Army, though hard to quantify, was too small to make an impact on the strength of that army, according to Aram Nerguizian from the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies.
Strategically important units of the Syrian armed forces are always controlled by Alawite officers; defecting soldiers – by July 2012 "tens of thousands" according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights – are mainly Sunni without access to vital command and control, Nerguizian said.
Analyst Joseph Holliday wrote in 2013 that "the Assad government has from the beginning of the conflict been unable to mobilize all of its forces without risking largescale defections.
The single greatest liability that the Assad regime has faced in employing its forces has been the challenge of relying on units to carry out orders to brutalize the opposition." This has resulted in Bashar's following his father's precedent by attaching regular army units to more reliable forces .
When Hafez al-Assad directed the suppression of revolts in Hama in 1982, this technique was also used.
The Syrian Arab Army suffers from serious recruitment issues as the Syrian Civil War drags on, with military age men across sectarian lines no longer willing to join or serve their conscription terms.
These issues are especially notable among the Druze population, who have clashed with regime security forces and broken Druze youths out of regime imprisonment to avoid them serving in the army.
Increasingly, Assad's Alawite base of support refuse to send their sons to the military due to massive casualty rates among military age men in their community; a third of 250,000 Alawite men of fighting age have been killed in the Syrian Civil War, leading to major tensions between the sect and the Assad regime.
As of mid-2018, then-Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said that the Syrian Arab Army had regained its pre-2011 strength levels, recovering from manpower shortages earlier in the Syrian Civil War.
The 3rd Armored Division has deployed elements of three brigades from its bases around Qutayfah to Deraa, Zabadani, and Hama, while the 11th Armored Division has stayed close to its bases in Homs and Hama.
The European Council named Major General Wajih Mahmud as commander of the 18th Armored Division in the Official Journal of the European Union on 15 November 2011, sanctioning him for violence committed in Homs.
Henry Boyd of the IISS noted that "in Homs, the 18th Armored Division was reinforced by Special Forces units and ...

Empowering ministers with sole financial initiative had an immediate and lasting impact.
Apart from achieving its intended purpose – to stabilise the budgetary process – it gave the Crown a leadership role in the Commons; and, the Lord Treasurer assumed a leading position among ministers.
The power of financial initiative was not, however, absolute.
Only Ministers might initiate money bills, but Parliament now reviewed and consented to them.
Standing Order 66 therefore represents the beginnings of Ministerial responsibility and accountability.
